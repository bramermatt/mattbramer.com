# TODO
This is very interesting and requiring a lot of thought. I am many things. And that many things will dictate how my site looks. Do I want this to be all about my software, or book reviews, or blogs, or my youtube videos, etc?

1. Husband
2. Father
3. Pastor
4. Podcaster
5. Video Maker
6. IT Help Desk Technician
7. Software Engineer
