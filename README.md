Working on creating a simple landing page for all things.. Matt Bramer.

In my career I've done a lot of different things ranging in Photography, Videography, Blogging, Music, Sales, and IT Work. 

This site should have access to all that, and more! 
But, for right now (06.10.22), it's a simple landing page.

I'm really enjoying this so far!

I've just now implemented two new branches (feat and post).
Instead of forcing updates to new features in main, I'm going to work in feat and then merge to main with new features.
Instead of adding posts to main, I'm going to add posts to post and then merge to main with new posts.
