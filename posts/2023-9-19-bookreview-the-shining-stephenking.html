    <h2>Written Review</h2>
    <p>Oh my, my, my! This was an absolute treat to read! This book was scary, and exciting, and really fun to read. There were twists and turns all over the place! This book was released in 1977, so there were a lot of things that could have been spoiled for you if you've been interested in this story at all. So, going into this story had been spoiled for me a bit, with the movie out as well. But, since I've finished the book, the movie actually changed some things. SO, not too much was spoiled for me.</p>
    
    <p>With that said, THIS WAS AWESOME! I really enjoyed reading this book. I enjoyed this story, and I was impressed with Stephen King's writing. I'd only ever listened to Carrie by Stephen King before and whoa, THIS WAS AWESOME!</p>
    
    <p>I loved the supernatural elements of this story, and how that was cleverly woven in with the "real world" characters, this was just an interesting story to read throughout. I think it's important to point out that I generally read ONLY FANTASY. So, reading this was a bit of a departure, but something that I have been looking forward to reading for some time now.</p>
    
    <p>I'm actually not going to spoil this story in anyway for you, even though it's been out for so long. I don't think that is important. I think you should go into this story as blind as you can. It is a treat to read.</p>
    
    <p>I wanted to be scared by this book, and I was. But I wasn't so scared that I couldn't read this in the dark where any bump in the night would scare me. But it was scary.</p>
    
    <p>The characters are VERY well developed and very believable here. There are some impressive characters here.</p>
    
    <p>The setting is expertly crafted and really Stephen King does a great job communicating isolation.</p>
    
    <p>Also, a very solid ending.</p>

        <h2>Emotional Impact. 5.</h2>
        <p>I WAS HOOKED as soon as this story started. And throughout. This was a great story.</p>
        
        <h2>Characters. 5.</h2>
        <p>Yes please, these characters were absolutely incredibly well written. Solid motivations and very real. Smart, and characters were very well separated from each other in their thoughts and feelings, and communication styles.</p>
        
        <h2>Plot. 5.</h2>
        <p>Something that I like to communicate about this story is "believable", but obviously "the shine" is not real, but I think this was an exciting, scary, and well developed plot!</p>
        
        <h2>Prose. 5.</h2>
        <p>Now this is something that I really enjoy. I am impressed with Stephen King and how he communicates everything. Beautiful, real, and exciting.</p>
        
        <h2>World Building. 5.</h2>
        <p>This is something that I am again impressed with! I will mention "the shine" and that is all. I think this was well executed and well described. There world was described and there were hints of more to come in the world.</p>
        
        <h2>Total Score 5/5</h2>
        <p>YES! 5/5! I'm so excited to read more Stephen King! Also, there is a sequel to this novel, <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/16130549-doctor-sleep" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Doctor Sleep</a>, first published September 24, 2013!</p>
