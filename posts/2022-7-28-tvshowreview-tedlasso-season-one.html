    <p>Now that's out of the way, let's talk Ted Lasso: Season One!</p>
    
    <h2 id="one">Season One</h2> 
    <p>I really enjoyed this show! I laughed, I cried, I loved it! The characters were awesome, there wasn't a single character that I didn't like! The humor was incredible, the story was exciting, the experience was great!</p>

    <blockquote>The Apple TV 4K</blockquote>
    <p>As with everyone who has Apple TV+, I somehow <em>have Apple TV+</em>. I didn't buy it, I don't pay a subscription, I might have a free trial but I never signed up for one.</p>
    
    <p>Overall, I'd say the experience is pretty legendary! It works seamlessly with all my Apple Devices and syncs up pretty nicely when I transition from screen to screen.</p>

    <blockquote>My Apple TV Widget</blockquote>
    
    <p>Here you can see some shows I've been watching. For some reason it says I'm on Ted Lasso Season One Episode Nine, but I just started Season Two Episode One today, so I'm not really sure the mixup here.</p>
    
    <h2 id="final">Final Score</h2>
    <p>I give Ted Lasso Season One on Apple TV+ a 5/5 Excellent!</p>
