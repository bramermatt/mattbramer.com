        <h2>Written Review</h2>
        <p>Oh wow did this book surpass A Crown of Swords, oh wow! I struggled with A Crown of Swords and this was, by no means, a struggle. SO GOOD! We got some resolution to something’s that have been devastating our characters for books now, and some characters are going off the deep end. There was action, intrigue, and an ending that is leading to more and more!</p>

        <p>There are questions I have and I’m excited to get reading onto the next book, I have the privilege of owning all the books. Luckily this series has been completed since 2013 so that’s awesome! I’ve thoroughly enjoyed the series so far.</p>
            
        <p>This book brought back the joy I had with the Wheel of Time. As I said, I struggled with the last book and this was a good book.</p>

        <h2>When I Started Reading</h2>
        <p>I'm really happy to be back reading the Wheel of Time. Make sure to check out my <a href="../../html/reviews/franchise/wheel-of-time-in-review.html">Wheel of Time in Review</a>!</p>

        <p>I am currently reading, as of June 19, 2023, so this is going to be a review in progress! And below, I'm going to have notes as I read, by chapter. More than likely spoilers, so I'm going to keep those hidden by the box below. When I've finished my read, the Notes box will be moved below the spoiler box, probably past the score!</p>

        <h2>Spoilers</h2>
        <p>Just a bit of preamble here.. the way this review will be is a lot of different from others. I'm wrote notes on every single chapter that I read. Which is completely spoiler, so this is where the spoilers start.. read at your own risk!</p>
    
        <p>And now I'm adding in predictions for upcoming books and more! Check that out below.</p>

<!-- spoilers -->
    <details id="spoilers">
        <summary>Spoilers</summary>

        <h2>Spoiler Review</h2>
        <p>There were so many things done right in the book! Wow! I had so much fun! Starting off with the Bowl of the Winds being used, then Moridin being a bad guy (also Moridin I think is Ishamael!), then we get some gholam perspectives, then the Seanchan ATTACK! The Bowl of the Winds brings SNOW! Rand gets dizzy from saidin and talks with LTT more. Rand really wants to cleanse saidin. There is a total oddness about saidin and saidar this book, and I think that’s all because the Bowl of the Winds used both saidin and saidar.</p> 

        <p>Gosh, so much happened in this book. Elayne and crew get to Caemlyn, not after Adeleas and Ispan (the Black Ajah member) were murdered (WHOA!). Elayne states her claims for the throne. Rand and crew go after the Seanchan and Rand gets shot but Healed quickly. Rand then uses Callandor and kills some of his own men, that and with the oddness in the One Power friendly fire was happening on both sides of the Seanchan and Rand’s crew.</p> 
            
        <p>Rand returns to Min in the Sun Palace and learns that the Sea Folk have granted him the use of their ships. He asks Cadsuane to be his advisor. She agrees, but she and Sorilea make a water oath to teach Rand laughter and tears. Five of the Tower Aes Sedai who kidnapped Rand swear to obey him, including Beldeine. Then four of Taim’s top lieutenants (Gedwyn, Rochaid, Torval, and Kisman) plus Dashiva try to kill Rand. They fail and escape, and are disavowed by Taim. Fedwin Morr succumbs to the taint; Rand is forced to poison him before fleeing the Sun Palace with Min. I have struggled with Taim for so long, and I still don’t know what to think of Taim, but there are a lot of Asha’man that have turned against Rand.</p> 
            
        <p>Oh my gosh! Egwene! Egwene and the Salidar crew opening up the novice book and now have over 1000 novices, including the Emond’s Field girls and have travelled to Tar Valon for their siege!! Such an epic ending!! </p>
            
        <p>Whoa Perrin! Queen Alliandre of Ghealdan swears fealty to Perrin. They rescue “Maighdin” (really Morgase) from the Prophet’s Dragonsworn marauders. “Maighdin” is angry at Perrin’s apparent rebellion against Andor but her group agrees to serve as Faile’s servants. Perrin argues with the Wise Ones who want the Prophet killed, and receives invaluable marital advice from Elyas Machera. Perrin visits the Prophet Masema to take him to Rand, but the Prophet refuses to Travel. Faile, Alliandre, Bain, Chiad, and Morgase are captured by Sevanna’s Shaido.</p>
            
        <p>The White Tower, Black Ajah Keeper Alviarin reasserts herself to Elaida, reminding her that Elaida will be finished if the Tower learns of her crimes. Alviarin is visited by a disguised Mesaana, but manages to glimpse part of the Forsaken’s dress through her disguise. Seaine and Pevara continue their efforts to root out the Black Ajah and in the process discover a spy from the rebel contingent. Sitters Saerin, Talene, Yukiri, and Doesine come upon them and deduce their mission; Talene is revealed as a Darkfriend.</p>
            
        <p>And Moridin and the Shadow are plotting against EVERYBODY! I can’t wait to see more out of the Shadow in the coming books!</p> 
            
        <p>Holy smokes! The Oath Rod! That’s how the Aes Sedai get the ageless face! The Oath, by holding an Oath Rod and having Spirit channeled, literally tightens on your skin and that’s where the ageless face comes from. Because your skin is tightened. Wow. Incredible! Also, something about the Oaths stunts the ages for these Aes Sedai. Yet, the Kin live for so much longer. There are loving Kin over three hundred years old! Wow! </p>

        <summary style="background-color: rgb(27, 105, 57);">Predictions and Theories</summary>
        <h2 style="font-style:italic;">Predictions</h2>
        <p>Let's see how I do, when I check back here after a few books.</p>

        <h2>From Lord of Choas</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Who is the lord of chaos, We still don't know.</li>
            <li>Where is Logain, We didn't see Logain at all this book.</li>
            <li>The cloud bowl, will it work? We got the bowl in the second to last chapter, haven't used it yet.</li>
            <li>Moiraine, Still dead, might be a part of some prophecies.</li>
            <li>Lan, Made it to Myrelle,then Egwene opened a Gateway for Lan to get to Ebou Dar.. then he got to Ebou Dar and saved Nynaeve from drowning and then Nynaeve was able to break her block by surrendering. Then Lan and Nynaeve got married!</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>What's Next?</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Mat's Dice, Okay, so Mat ending this book with a building falling on top of him as the Seanchan invaded Ebou Dar. I have no idea what the Dice are really for, and I want to know what is going on. Also, I don't believe Mat dead.. can't be!</li>
            <li>Alanna's Bond, We keep getting little bits of this, but I'm really interested in this. I want to know if Rand will be able to break this or not.</li>
            <li>Moiraine is Not Dead, From the Fires of Heaven, I still think Moiraine is not dead. Neither is Lanfear. We don't know much about where they are - in that doorway ter'angreal. No way they're dead! I'm excited to learn more about them.</li>
            <li>LTT in Rand's Head, The end of this book didn't have much about this, I'm still interested!</li>
            <li>The Watcher, Moirdin, I THINK THIS IS ISHAMAEL! We haven't gotten any confirmation, but I THINK IT'S ISHAMAEL. I'm so excited about this prediction. Because.. (this is from chapter 20) The Watcher. Okay, I'm going to rant a bit here. THIS IS ISHAMAEL! YES YES YES! Oh, i'm so excited about this prediction. This is Ishamael. He's back! Using the **True Power** holy cow!! WOW. Okay, first off, I was wrong, the two Caddar and Maisia was Sammael and Graendal. ANyway, this is Ishamael, for sure. I am excited to learn more about this True Power, the one that Lanfear and.. someone I can't remember was trying to get/use in the Rhuidean visions. Wow. Okay, so this True Power comes straight from the Great Lord and the Watcher... Ishamael, sees black flecks in his vision. Gosh I'm just so excited about this prediction. Mesaan ahad a hand in kidnapping Rand. Graendal won't risk teaching the Wise Ones Compulsion unless Sammael has found a binder.. nice! The Watcher, Ishamael, is covered in fancloth except for his eyes so he can't be seen. Graendal hates the name Maisia. Sammael opens a Gateway, and eventually Graendal follows. The Watcher feels the prickling of saidar end and smiles crookedly. He decides not to kill the eight women. AND RIPS A HOLE IN THE PATTERN WITH THE TRUE POWER AND STEPS OUTSIDE THE PATTERN. HO-LY CRAP! Ishamael. Ishamael. Also more and more predictions. Ishamael will be Nae'blis. Ishamael is the Lord of Chaos. Ishamael. YES YES YES!<br><br>Why do I think that? Honestly, I think this only because we've gotten Osan'gar and Aran'gar come back, so now we know that Forsaken can come back. But this True Power thing has me feeling Ishamael. It was a feeling I got with how knowledgable the Water seemed with the world and Sammi and Graendi. And how excited he was to use the True Power. And his skin prickled when Graendi channeled. And this person is clearly from AOL and at least super knowledgeable with saidin and the Pattern to be able to step outside. And I am just begging for Ishi to come back.. lol</li>
            <li>Egwene and Aes Sedai Fealty, Egwene has several Aes Sedai swear featly directly to Egwene and that hasn't happened EVER BEFORE. I'm excited to find out what are the ramifications for this.</li> 
            <li>Cadsuane, She is probably not a Darkfriend, but she is fiesty. She isn't going to be good for Rand or Asha'man.</li>
            <li>Seanchan, THEY'RE BACK! Oh this is going to be crazy, I'm so excited about this.</li>
        </ol>

        <summary style="background-color:rgb(27, 86, 105);">Notes As I Read</summary>
   
        <h2>Prologue, Deceptive Appearances, Wheel and Snake</h2>
        <p><strong>Ethenielle.</strong> First off, is this going to be all Seanchan book?! A lot of Seanchan notes as the first sayings.. sweet! THIS IS GOING TO BE CRAZY! RJ is showing off here. All these new names are just crazy lol. Going to be a lot of fun to try and remember these names. Okay, Ethenielle, queen of Kandor.. according to the map and the words on the pages - we are close to the Blight in the Borderlands! The King of Arafel, Paitar Nachiman. The King of Shienar, Easar Togita. AGELMAR! The Blight has been quiet lately.. uh oh. Don't speak too soon. Tenobia Kazadi, Queen of Saldaea. </p>

        <p>I started writing this because.. when Tenobia comes, there is a mention to Tenobia not being married and if she were to die the right would go to Davram or to Davram's heir... oh oh! FAILE! Is that possible?! Could Faile get Saldaea, which would mean Perrin and Faile would have Saldaea? Whoa! That's cool! Prediction: Tenobia = dead, Davram = dead, Faile Queen of Saldaea! No idea how or when.. just that's the prediction.. okay READING ON!</p>

        <p>This is a cool ceremony of the blood oath! However, We've got thirteen Aes Sedai and they're close. Now, after this blood oath they are going to *find Rand and "do what needed to be done, whatever the price"*... oh no.</p>

        <p><strong>Verin.</strong> Verin! Okay.. so Verin is a sneaky Aes Sedai, but for the Light! So that's good lol. Verin is using some Compulsion but not Compulsion. She is giving orders to the Aes Sedai that kidnapped Rand, at least the ones that are still here under Wise One watch. Katerine escaped last night.. oh no! Verin is in the Aiel camp near Cairhien. The captured Aes Sedai are da'tsang. Verin has a plan of her own. It's been seventy-one years since Verin's last serious mistake. some Wise Ones know how to Link now. Verin knows Cadsuane, vaguely. Rand's ta'veren caused Verin to swear fealty. Verin has an angreal! small flower brooch. Verin learned this Compulsion from wilders who've come to the White Tower. Verin also, and we've known this.. I think, has a notebook where she writes a cipher of notes down and one day she wants to write out what each picture / icon means. She did drop the notebook and a Wise One picked it up but didn't understand the pictues. WOW! GO VERIN! Verin won't use Compulsion on a man because it works poorly on them. Verin grew up in Far Medding and would've married Eadwin, but she went to the White Tower. Verin thinks she has to keep Rand alive until it's time for him to die. Whoa. </p>

        <p><strong>Moridin.</strong> I am sticking to my guns, Moridin is Ishamael. I will hold out that hope. Okay, Moridin is in a room with no doors or windows studying a game of sha'rah. Sha'rah, tcheran, and no'ri (now known as stones) were played in the Age of Legends. He wears two mindtraps (we saw that last book - one is Mogi). A servant comes with lank eyes to bring him wine.. Blank eyes.. Ishamael did this at the Darkfriend social. Oh RJ.. just tell me already! The key piece in sha'rah is the Fisher a man with a blindfold and a wounded side. "only nine people living even remembered the game". So much to think about here.. wow. Recollection of a disaster brings him to fury and Moridin seizes the True Power nearly crushing the mindtraps and the Fisher piece. Moridin is playing both sides of the board and is thinking about Rand al'Thor!! OH OH!</p>

        <h2>Ch 1, To Keep the Bargain, Sea Folk</h2>
        <p><strong>Aviendha.</strong> I tell you what, I'm anxious! I'm on edge! The Seanchan are there y'all! Why aren't they attacking these Aes Sedai? Anyway, THE WIND PASSES TEMALKING!!!! WE ARE GOING TO GET SOME USE OF THOSE GIANT STATUES! This is neat, the Amayar people who follow the Water Way. They have their own prophecy of the giant statue. The wind passes over the Sea of Sorms to Altara. Seafaring folk use the wind and currents to travel from World's End to Mayene and beyond. WHOA! COOL! Okay, so Aviendha is ready to leave Ebou Dar.. me too girl. Aviendha feels watched. Teslyn is there and the girls warn her about Moghedien, the gholam, the Black Ajah, and the coming storm. Teslyn doesn't believe them. It's the day after the Festival of Birds, the day of the Feast of Embers, there will be fireworks by an Illuminator, woo! There will be traveling shows as well... VALAN LUCA! Okay, this crew goes to the palace stableyard where twenty Sea Folk, five Aes Sedai, five Warders, and eleven Kin. Ispan is there, drugged, shielded and guarded. Avi opens a gateway - she has trouble and thinks its like a mirage in Termool, what? Elayne taught her the gateway because she can't remember hwo she did it before. Aviendha feels watched again and spots a man watching from the top of a spire! She tells a Windfinder to warn Elayne and Nynaeve. Here we go.</p>

        <h2>Ch 2, Unweaving, Forsnaken</h2>
        <p><strong>Elayne.</strong> Oh wow cool, Elayne senses where Birgitte went (warder sense, not the right name I'm sure), the Careane + Cieryl, and Nynaeve is looking the direction Lan went.. but it was his track that Nynaeve saw! WHAT A GOOD CALL BACK! So, first off - will we ever use this Bowl?? Anyways a circle of thirteen need to run the Bowl. In addition to Traveling, linking is one of the skills the Aes Sedai will teach the Windfinders. Rainyn (Windfinder) is as strong as Romanda and the apprentice Metarra is as strong as Elayne and another apprentice Talaan is as strong as Nynaeve.. WHOA! STRONG. Elayne is looking through a panier bag and finds a blue stone root-like carving, a small ivory box with red and green stripes, a stiff flexible black rod, a tiny vial of red liquid, a two foot statue of jolly bearded man holding a book. Nynaeve says the rod feels like pain. Elayne finds an angreal, an amber turtle brooch. It's not too strong, but it will give her twice the strength of Nynaeve! STRONG. Can Elayne learn to make angreal too?? MY GUESS = YES! Vandene warns about the danger of ter'angreal, twenty five years ago Martine Janata burned herself out studying ter'angreal for forty years. Aviendha begins to unweave the gateway.. and everyone is shocked! Aviendha tells them it is the only way not to leave residue that can be analyzed or recreated. Aiel Wise Ones are trained in unweaveing. Aviendha can read residues as much as two days later - a very rare Talen. Nice! MORE PERSPECTIVES!</p>

        <p><strong>Moridin.</strong> WHOA! Moridin is pumped to see what Aviendha did.. unravelling the weave. WHOA! I am a sucker for RJ's writing. "Ripped a hole in the Pattern to Travel". Ugh, amazing. Okay, the man Aviendha saw was Moridin (Ishamael - my prediction). He ponders the new things that weren't known in AOL - Healing severing, involuntary Linking, Warder bonds, unweaving, and the strength of the Windfinders in weather control. A palace servant Madic tells Moridin the treasure if from AOL, Shiota and Eharon. Miridin never heard of the Bowl of the Winds before and now he is concerned they may fix the weather. Then he accidentally kills Madic. Moridin wants to stop them from using the Bowl or make them pay. </p>

        <p><strong>Gholam.</strong> Oh sweet a gholam POV! Okay, this gholam has never been hurt before. It also feels an itch with the power being used but doesn't know it as the True Power... oh oh! Is Rand going to use the True Power to destroy all the gholams? That'd be neat! I wonder if the gholam has something to do with the taint? Probs not. If the taint is gone, are gholams still around? probably. Anyways the gholam has faded memories. It can feel both the gateway in the stablewayrd and the other one miles northeast. It was commanded to kill Mat and the women. It is following the women because they are an easier target. It lives on fresh blood, Madic is warm fresh blood for it. It is going to follow the women.</p>

        <h2>Ch 3, A Pleasant Ride, Wheel and Snake</h2>
        <p><strong>Elayne.</strong> I am grinding my teeth. WE ARE DRAGGING. This whole chapter people talked, Adeleas somehow had flies ignore her, Aviendha was upset because Kurin didn't deliver her warning. Eventually we arrive at the farm. Let's use the Bowl of the Winds. This seems like such padding, this chapter. Wait.. they past the statue of a Shiotan Warrior Queen, barefoot statue. Is that the other statue for the sa'angreal Rand has?? Okay, maybe I'm jumping to conclusions here, and I just need to read and enjoy and read and find out. I recant my statment.. lol. This book is taking it's time.</p>

        <h2>Ch 4, A Quiet Place, Darkfriend Women</h2>
        <p><strong>Elayne.</strong> We're at the Kin farm. We meet Alise. There are only women at the farm, the Kin don't marry. Panic ensues because these are Aes Sedai. Windfinders are saddle sore. Garenia is there, who? Elayne wonders about ageleessness. Vandene and Adeleas question Ispan - she claims Elaida sent her. Elayne want question Ispan, Tower law is too restrictive. V and A keep on. Elayne finds more ter'angreal. She andAviendhafind the following - ajewelry setmeant to be worn together, a dull dagger with a gold wrapped horn hilt, lots more jewelry, statuettes of birds and animals and people, more knives, a thick red rod which feels warm, a set of metal balls and a glass blacksmith's puzzle. Aviendha handles the dull dagger and seems curiously affected by it. There are also two more angreal - a gold bracelet and rings, stronger than the amber turtle, and an ivory statuette of seated woman, weaker than amber turtle. Keeping that for later.. and Nynaeve Heals the Sea Folk riding bruises and she says "it's time" to use the Bowl lol. Let's see.</p> 


        <h2>Ch 5, The Breaking Storm, Lion</h2>
        <p><strong>Elayne.</strong> THE BOWL HAS BEEN USED! I was way wrong. And now I am certainly excited! This is what I was waiting for. I was waiting
        for the Seanchan to show up. A lot about linking, this is super cool but… Caire leads and activates the Bowl using all five Powers. The Bowl starts drawing even more saidar and also draws saidin! A huge column of both rises into the air.
        IT HAS STARTED!! SO SO COOL! Okay, so here we go. So no one is going back to Mat or Olver, ahh. Yes yes yes! The Bowl has been used! Elayne gives the seated woman angreal to Aviendha, the bracelet and rings to Nynaeve and the amber turtle to Talaan. Thirteen women will form a circle around the Bowl - Talaan din Gelyn, Metarra din Junalle, Rainyn, Naime, Rysael,Tebreille din Gelyn South Wind,Caire din Gelyn Running Wave, Nynaeve, Elayne, Aviendha, Reanne, Kirstian and Garenia. Caire, who has studied Bowl lore, leads the circle. Nynaeve and Elayne teach the Windfinders how to link. The process of Linking is described in detail. Sareitha has studied Linking extensively. She implies that she and a few other sisters know how to bring men
        into a circle! SEANCHAN!</p>

        <h2>Ch 6, Threads, Seanchan</h2>
        <p><strong>Elayne.</strong>  I LOVE THIS! Let's begin.. 147 Kin are at the farm and they all need to leave to avoid capture and leashing by the Seanchan. Even the Warders help the leaving. Note: only the One Power can break most ter'angreal. Elayne is VERY POSSESSIVE OF THE ANGREAL.. WHOA! Careane keeps watch on the hill, Ispane seems a bit meek after her questioning with V and A. OH OH! Renaile tries to keep the Bowl and the amber turtle angreal but Alise gets them back and Merilille gets the amber turle. Hey, I'm a big fan of this Alise, she is able to whip everyone into shape FAST! And I love her with Nynaeve.. "she can't find my *hat*", Nynaeve, and then she does find Nynaeve's hat... hahahaha. Okay! ELAYNE IS MAKING A GATEWAY TO CAEMLYN! WOOO! We're almost there.. and then! Elayne is tired from the Bowl and saidar isn't working properly because she's tired. Elayne starts to take apart the weave so the Seanchan can't read the residue or to learn how to make a gateway. Everyone rides off except Birgitte and Aviendha. The Seanchan start their attack and they literally come through the gateway WHOA!! A damane shields Elayne, then the gateway explodes leveling the ground for hundreds of yards and injurs a lot! Lioness.. dead. Birgitte's horse ran away real fast! Neighter Elayne or Aviendha can Heal very well. Elayne thinks the gateway explosion is a new weapon but Avi says no.. anything can happen when unraveling a gateway.. explosion, light, or nothing. Then.. love. Elayne and Avi agree to become first-sisters. Lan and Nynave ride up. Next perspective! </p>

        <p><strong>Chulein.</strong> RJ still showing off. These Seanchan are cool (relatively, we don't like slavery and such - it's on the list), but so cool to see this as a fully realized group. Chulein, a morat'raken is riding her raken, Segani. Tauan and Macu were killed by fireballs, nice. There are six sul'dam and damane on the ground. Suroth is on her way to Ebou Dar. Chulein's co-rider is Eliya, they've never seen fireworks but demane make similar displays called Sky Lights. The explosion of the farm rocks Segani and it knows Eliya off. Chulein is lucky to have escaped the Lady of the Shadows.. who? That's awesome. Chulein heads back to Ebou Dar to report this new Aes Sedai weapon.... </p>


        <h2>Ch 7, A Goatpen, Wolf</h2>
        <p><strong>Perrin.</strong> Ta'veren if I've ever seen one.. MORGASE! This is going to be good, I'm excited at least. Okay, Perrin and his forces are in Ghealdan near the town of Bethal where Queen Alliandre Marithia Gigarin is staying. He hears thunder off to the west. They are where the Prophet is doing his Prophet work lol, just out of Whitecloak range. Rumors are about that Amador has fallen.. yes yes it has. Perrin and crew are looking to keep a low profile. Faile, Aram, Berelain, Annoura, Gallenne, Seonid, Edarra, and Nevarin. Asha'man Grady and Neald are back in the camp, all the channelers felt a streak of the One Power more than half a week ago! (BOWL OF THE WINDS!!). Perrin sends Berelain, Gallenne, and Annoura to Queen Alliandre. Perrin's crew rides back towards camp BUT Aram notices a fight at an abandoned farm.. turns out its Maighdin (MORGASE!). Teryl captures of on the Prphet's men who was attacking, who says "Hari, his leader, got away". Perrin releases one they caught with a message to Masema, that Perrin Aybara, in the name of the Lord Dragon, will hang anyone committing crimes. OH OH! Maighdin (Morgase) accepts Perrin's offer of protection and Perrin recognizes two of the men. Also, the channelers create firewords to scare off the attackers.</p>

        <h2>Ch 8, A Simple Country Woman, Lion</h2>
        <p><strong>Perrin.</strong> Maighdin reminds Perrin of.... Elayne. lol. Okay Perrin. I'm really not sure if Perrin ever met Morgase, anyways - They're back at camp. Nine hundred Winged Guards, three hundred TR Men, three hundred Dobraine's men, more Wise Ones and gai'shain, Maidens led by Sulin. Berelain has two maids and two thief-cathers. Maighdin is angry about the Manetheren banner, Perrin tells Morgase (Maighdin) that Rand plans to put Elayne on the throne, and she is angry that it is Elayne's by right not by Rand. Perrin talks to Basel Gill because he recognizes him and Lamghwin. Perrin learns the Seanchan attack is real. Lini wants Perrin to marry Tallanvor and Morgase. Faile offers to make Morgase and her group Faile's servants. Morgase accepts and leaves to tell the others. Perrin tells Faile about the Seanchan. Perrin wants to send Grady or Neald to warn Rand but Rand insisted on absolute secrecy. Faile says Rand must've heard by now. Faile suggests flaunting the Manetheren banner to hide their true intent and he likes the idea and then studies maps.</p>
    
<p>
    <strong>Faile.</strong> Whoa Faile. What is going on?! Cha Faile - the Falcon's Talon. Oh boy. Faile snuck out of the tent to talk to her society.. Selande, Meralda, and Camaille report that Alliandre is staying at Lord Telabin's palace. Selande is second in command. Faile gives them new instructions for Bethal. That morning Faile sent ten of them to scout Bethal.... Faile, I have a bad feeling about this. 
</p>
    
<p>
    <strong>Morgase.</strong> I guess we can say Morgase, that's what I'm going to say. Anyways, let's just do this already Morgase, you and Tallanvor - I ship! Come on already! Alright, Morgase he is calling herself Maighdin Dorlain, Maighdin for her mother and Dorlain for a family on one of her estates. And, Lini told Tallanvor she abdicated. I guess that's still how that works. And Morgase still thinks Elayne is in the White Tower and she wants to protect her from Rand. 
</p>


<h2>Ch 9, Tangles, Wheel and Snake</h2>
<p><strong>Perrin.</strong> So the Wise Ones want to kill Masema. Hmm. Oh. It might be a good idea, but will that mean that the people following Masema, who are supposed to be following Rand, will go after Rand? It's sticky. I just don't know what the best plan is. I'm noticing this book has a lot of chapters that are around 20+ pages a chapter. This is another building book.. Anyways, Gill is assigned to Faile as shambayan, and he is going to Bethal to get some Two Rivers tabac and other fine goods. Gill is going with Tallanvor, Lamgwin, and some of Faile's retainers. Balwer offers to serve as secretary and information source to Perrin. Balwer knows a little about the Seanchan and the Whitecloaks and that Masema is in Abila forty leagues south. Balwer also warns of Valda and Asunawa. Perrin sends Aram to make friends with Faile's servants. Perrin goes to the Wise Ones and they tell him that Masema Dagar is a danger to Rand, three dreamwalkers have said so. Perrin again brings up the Aes Sedai and the Wise Ones say the Aes Sedai are apprentinces. Seonid, with the Wise One's permission, tell Perrin about what the Dragonsworn do and agrees that the Prophet has to go. The Wise Ones tell Perrin that Masuri Sokawa think Masema can be controlled. The Wise Ones send Seonid off to one of the gai'shain Gharadin and to ask him to Heal a wound. Perrin settles down for a long discussion. 
</p>

<h2>Ch 10, Changes, Wolf</h2>
<p><strong>Perrin.</strong> ELYAS!!! Oh this is awesome. I was just thinking about Elyas. Okay, so Elyas is here and he snuck up on Gaul, apparenlty the only Aiel not gai'shain.. interesting. The wolves told Elyas about Perrin. Elyas says the wolves smell a change coming. Elyas is nervous about the Aes Sedai. Elyas can still feel his Aes Sedai, Rina, and she is still alive. I forgot Elyas was a Warder, so this was a great recap! Most Aes Sedai will free their Warder, if he really wants to go, but Elyas ran away. He describes how an Aes Sedai can "fuzz" the Warder bond so that all he can tell is that she is alive. They talk about the Warder bond and sensing direction and that *tweaks Perrin's memory* hmm.. Elyas also gives Perrin advice how to handle a Saldaean women. They see Berelain, Annoura, Gallenne and another woman ride up to Perrin's tent. Elyas warns Perrin that Gallenne is not too smart and only knows how to attack. Elyas agrees to stay with Perrin's party. In the tent Breane and Maighdin are serving punch and Lini puts away cloaks. The other woman is Alliandre Maritha Kigarin, Queen of Ghealdan, Blessed of the Light, Defender of Garen's Wall. Four days ago Rand took Illian and seven days ago the Seanchan took Ebou Dar. That same day Grady and the other channelers sensed the One Power in the sky. The Queen of Ghealdan came in secret. Lord Telabin doesn't know she left. She then swears fealty to Perrin and through him, Rand. She confirms that the Prophet is in Abila, Balwer was right. Perrin and Gallenne leave to go to the Mayener camp. 
</p>
    
<p>
    <strong>Faile.</strong> Faile dismisses the servants and asks Annoura to set up a ward. Annoura told Berelain that Maighdin is a wilder! THAT IS AWESOME! lol, I do wonder how long it will take for everyone to realize this is Morgase... hmmm. Faile is beginning to respect Berelain. She insists that Alliandre and some of her troops accompany them south. Alliandre will send messages to her nobles and to Masema that someone has raised the banner of Manetheren and she will chase them down. Faile thinks that she must get word to her people in Bethal that they will not have to kidnap Alliandre after all! I see what's happening here, and I'M INTERESTED! 
</p>
    
<p>
    <strong>Perrin.</strong> It begins to rain! Perrin and Gallenne go to the Mayener camp, Aram is there. There is a crowd around a group of scouts with prisoners - Nurelle has Squadman Ortis report. They caught seven Dragonsworn murdering a family. Perrin has them hanged. and then it rains quickly then the storm passes. I like this Perrin hanging these fellows. I agree, I think Rand would do the same. These people killed some people on a farm because "people tend to slide back into the Shadow". Something is going to happen this book, and I really don't know if Masema will die. Maybe. I feel like that might be necessary, but I JUST DON'T KNOW!
</p>
    
<h2>Ch 11, Questions and an Oath, Aiel</h2>
<p><strong>Sevanna.</strong> Sevanna and the Shaido Wise Ones Rhiale, Someryn, Meira, Tion, Alarys, and Modarra question and kill a Seanchan soldier. Putting prisoners to the question is usually done by Maidens or Black Eyes. This crew is in Ghealdan and have been there for ten days. The Wise Ones are more and more unhappy with Sevanna and they make a stand against her. Her grip on them is weakening. She admits that Caddar (Sammael) betrayed them, but she took all the Shaido channelers with her and the Jumai. Efalin waits outside, with the Maidens who captured the Seanchan solider. They're at a manor house they took over and made all the residents gai'shain. There are four thousand algai'd'siswai, two-thrds Mera'din and over three hundred Wise Ones with them.. WHOA! One of the Mera'din, Kinhuin, approaches and asks them to help a dispute about sharing spoils with the Jumai. Sevanna sends the six Wise Ones with Kinhuin and then she goes in another direction. She then feels for one of Caddar (Sammael)'s thing that she can use on Rand.
</p>
    
<p>
    <strong>Galina.</strong> WHOA! Okay let's do this. Galina is shielded by Belinde and guarded by Maidens. She is also in a leather bag over a fire and covered with burning powerder. She is being punished for slapping Bleinde. Sevanna arrives and asks Galina to swear obedience to her and shows her the Oath Rod (I think that's what I'm going to call it). Galina thinks it looks like an Oath Rod except there are numerals (111) where the White Tower Oath Rod has numerals (3). Galina think this rod is like a hooded viper from te Drowned Lands.. whatever that is. Therava arrives with a dozen Wise Ones - Emerys, Modarra, Norlea, Rhiale, Someryn, and Tion. The Maidens leave. Thereavea challenges Sevanna. They have Galinda swear obedience on this Oath Rod to all the Wise Ones and to Sevanna and Therava first among them. Galina feels the Oath settle on her and her skin tighten just as with the Oath Rod... Therava keeps this Oath Rod and Galina will now be gai'shain. Therava will be Sevanna's advisor. Therava takes this role and recommends that they move away from the Seanchan, north to the Mountains of Mist.. but Sevanna says yes and no.. she wants to go East. Then is begins to SNOW! OH BOY!
</p>
    
<p>
    Ch 12
    New Alliances, Forsnaken
    Graendal. WHOA! Okay, Graendal is in her palace in Arad Doman. She forges a letter from King Alsalam to Lord Rodel Ituralde and seals it with the Hand and Sword of Arad Doman. She gives it to Nazran, a close cousin to the king, who will say Lady Tuva gave it to him after being mortally wounded by a Gray Man. The letter should create great chaos. Graendal is wearing a gold ring angreal that she found among Sammael's possessions in his chambers in the Great Hall of the Council. So, this chapter and the people that come next say "Sammael is dead". So, that's what I'm to assume now. I was confused at the end of the last book if he were actually dead or not. Now, it is.. *confirmed*? I'm going to go with it. Sammael is dead. Okay.. next! A chime sounds as a gateway is created.. I love this. Graendal says she appreciates the courtesy of a previous age. Apparenlty this is like a doorbell that you have to answer to allow someone entrance.. that's awesome! So, Moghedien and a stranger named Cyndane, which means "Last Chance" in the OT. Cyndane is stronger in the OP than Graendal. They both wear red and black livery. Cyndane tells G that Sammael is dead. G acknowledges occasional contact with Sammael. Cyndane tells G that she is in charge because of Mogi's recent mistakes. Both of them start and shudder. They tell her Moridin is Nae'blis and G is to serve him too. G doesn't beleive them, telling them to tell Demandred or Semirhage. Mogi channels out the lights. G channels a signle light and traps Mogi and Cyndane with Compulsion. Then G is cut off from the True Source. Shadar Haran is there. He steps out of the shadows.. Aginor thought Fadse were slightly out of phase with time and reality. SH says that when G speaks with him that he is the voice of the Great Lord. G agrees to obey him, his first order is to visit Moridin, but she doesn't tell him about the letter she just sent.
</p>
    
<p>
    Thoughts - who is Cyndane? My first thought was Halima / Balthamel. And that's all I can really think of, since G doesn't really know who she is. That would make sense if Moridin (who I think is Ishamael) put them together... I like the idea that Ishamael is Nae'blis. That'd be great! What is going on with this Shaidar Haran... I DON'T KNOW!
</p>
    
<p>
    Cadsuane. Things are picking up.. IMO. Okay, Cadsuane is on her way to the Sun Palace with Daigian and Kumira (Brown) .It is getting cold and stormy! WOO! She has been coming to the plaace for over a week, they are greeted by Corgaide, Holder of the Keys (WHAT A TITLE!), the head servant. Faeldrin, Merana, and Bera are there, the Wise Ones gave them a day off because of the rain. Cadsuane is taken to a quiet room and asks for Alanna. Cadsuane has been asking Alanna for her info on Rand, but she is unwilling and unable to tell more. When Alanna hold saidar, one of Cadsuane's hair ornaments (intertwined golden crescents) feels cold. BOOM WOW, BOMB SHELL! Oh, I wonder if Cadsuane went to the Snake / Fox place and asked for something like that? ORRRRR, she knew how to make one of those or had them made for her... QUESTIONS!!! SO COOL! Cadsuane has little sympathy for Alanna or for Moiraine and Elaida who have bungled. She is also ticked off at herself for being off chasing Logain and Taim instead of Rand. Alanna has been Aes Sedai over twenty years. Sorilea comes and says the Aes Sedai are having a hard time learning Wise One methods of weaving because they use almost no hand gestures. Once one has learned one way, learning another is very difficult... oh oh interesting! This is one reason wilders are disliked. When Sorilea asks, Cadsuane tells her that punishing Alanna will not hurt Rand. In return, Sorilea advises Cadsuane to act indifferent to Rand and not chase after him, good advice. They talk about Rand being hard and brittle rather than strong and enduring. They cautiously agree that their targets may not be too different. As a final gift, Sorilea teaches Cadsuane the weave for Traveling.[12] Sorilea offers Cadsuane water oath to teach Rand laughter and tears and Cadsuane accepts. WHOA! I'M PUMPED THAT SO MANY PEOPLE ARE LEARNING HOW TO TRAVEL.. COULDN'T POSSIBLY BE ANY BAD OUTCOMES HERE....

    Ch 13
    Floating Like Snow, Dragon
    Rand. I'm happy to be in Rand's POV again. This is a little dower, but I'm happy. Anyways, Rand is in eastern Illian riding Tai'daishar and holding saidin. He is with the Illian Council of Nine members - Gregorian and Marac, First Captain Demetre Marcolin, Tairen High Lords Weiramon, Tolmeran, Aracome, Maraconn, Gueyam, High Lady Rosana, and Cairhienin Lord Semaradrid. There are two or three thousand of Sammael's men nearby, most of them have been disbanded because of "Lord Brend's" death and Mattin Stepaneos vanishing. LTT hasn't come back to Rand but these flashing swirling colors continue to appear and I'M INTERESTED! Alanna is becoming easier for him. Rand calls Dashiva and Eben Hopwil (both now full Asha'man) over. Hopwil brought news of Seanchan in Amador, Morr is checking out Ebou Dar. Rand thinks about the women who died for him. Rand rides forward with Gregorin, Marcolin, Dashiva, and Hopwil. Rand speaks with the *leader* of the men, and says they can join Rand or lay down their arms and go home. The men complain they must defend themselves against Dragonsworn and Aiel, and Rand amplifies his voice with Air and Fire to all the hiding men, and says Davram Bashere and his Aiel are dealing with them. Rand leaves and gives them the choice by midday. Rand lets go of saidin and gets dizzy and sees double. This is a recent problem.. uh oh. Rand also wondering if Sammael was responsible for the Aiel all over Illian.. yes he was! 
</p>
    
<p>
    Ch 14
    Message from the M'Hael, Dragon Fang
    Rand. I'M SO EXCITED. Could Rand really cleanse saidin? What would that look like? How would he do that? What would that do for these shifty Asha'man? QUESTIONS! Anyway, Rand is back in camp using Mattin Stepaneos tent. Damar Flinn is there and tells Rand that Torval arrived and is waiting with Narishma. Rand goes to meet them with Dashiva and Hopwil. Rand promoted Flinn, Narishma, and Morr as well. Torval tells Rand there are definitely Aes Sedai in Murandy. Rand says to leave them alone. Torval brought a message from Taim - there are twenty-nine Asha'man, ninety-seven Dedicated, and three hundred twenty-two Soldiers at the BT. He has about fifty recrutiing parties bringing in three or four every day. He "harvested that blackberry bush himself, getting a surprising number of berries", what the heck does that mean?! Rand presses Torval adds that there have been nineteen deserters also, thirteen burned out, twenty-eight dead, and ten insanse that Taim poisoned. Morr arrives with news of the Seanchan - they will soon move to Illian next. The SC have been in ED barely more than a week but they've already moved soldiers to the Venir Mountains all the way to Arran Head. Between Arran Head and the city of Illian lies the Kabal Deep. Morr says saidin is worst northeast of ED where there was an explosion. Dashiva says saidin misbehaving is impossible.. odd. This is where Rand thinks about hwo to cleanse saidin - the answer he got was a riddle that Herid Fel said stated "sound principles, in both high philosophy and natural philosophy".. huh? Rand thinks he knows the answer. Rand realizes he spoke outloud - I love this trope.. honestly, I do. Things that people really want to know that they accidentally hear.. so good! Torval, Narishma, Morr, and Hopwil look at him with wonder and hope! Dashiva looks poleaxed (what is that word?? lol). Rand gives order - Torval heads to BT with orders for Taim. Rand sends Narishma on a special mission. LTT's voice returns!!! Rand is crying and laughing when Weiramon, Gregorin, Tolmeran, Rosana, and Semaradrid arrive with news that Sammael's men have acquiesced. 
</p>
    
<p>
    Should we trust the BT.... I WANT TO SO BADLY. I WANT TO TRUST THEM. I am struggling with that trust. I kept flip-flopping with Taim when we first met him and had a lot of communication with him, but Rand not visiting the BT and seeing what's happening... I JUST DON'T KNOW! And Torval seemed a bit apprehensive about Rand coming to the BT... I DON'T KNOW!
</p>

    Stronger Than Written Law, Rose and Bull
    Egwene. Hey hey, like I've said.. we're building here! I'm so pumped for this showdown of the Salidar Aes Sedai + Bryne's thirty thousand to take the White Tower. So, Egwene awakens from a series of dreams: Rand wearing different masks until one false faces is no longer a mask but him. Perrina and a Tinker, hacking their way through brambles with axe and swords, unaware of a cliff ahead. The brambles screamed with human voices they didn't hear. Mat weighing two Aes Sedai on a huge set of balance scales on his decision depended.. something vast that depended on Mat, the world maybe? Eg wakes, Siuan is waking Eg despite Halima's protests. Halima now shares Eg's tent. Nisao's Healing doesn't help Eg's headaches. Siuan takes Eg to Bryne. It is snowing now.. cool. Elayne reported to Eg that only the Bowl of the Winds had been used. Eg is upset that Siuan hadn't told her about the Kin. Leane guards the tent while Bryne reports an army of Andorans and Murandians to the north led by Pelivar and Arathelle, near the Armahn river. Eg wants Bryne to arrange a meeting with them - Bryne's army is 30,000 now. Eg asks Bryne how long they need to rest before taking TV, he says 10 days but a month would be better. Bryne says Elaida has increased the Tower Guard to 50,000.. whoa! Eg tells Siuan that she plans to do away with the Three Oaths, Siuan is shocked! Then Siuan lectures Eg on the value of the Three Oaths. Eg realizes Siuan is in love with Bryne, and then tells Siuan to send Beonin, Anaiya, and Myrelle north - they have five Warder between them. Siuan will also tell Sheriam, Carlinya, Morvrin, and Nisao to prepare for the morning. Eg hope she will be a successful Amyrlin and not a failure.

    Unexpected Absences, Flame of Tar Avalon
    Egwene. Egwene talks to the Hall. They’re going to sit and wait for three days. Egwene goes over notes with Siuan. Yep, that’s it.
</p> 
    
<p>
    Aran’gar. Halima / Balthamel (still hasn’t been confirmed yet if that’s who Halima is) buried someone in the snow. She is watching soldiers. She thinks about her dreams. She thinks she could kill all these Aes Sedai but the DO wouldn’t be happy. 
</p>
    
<p>
    Egwene. Oh oh!! Lelaine and Romanda comes ant talk to Egwene about Rand visiting the Sea Folk (in Cairhien). Lelaine wants Elayne and Nynaeve to pass a message to Merilille to contact the Sea Folk in Caemlyn. They refuse to believe that Windfinders are better at Cloud Dancing than Aes Sedai. Chesa brings tea and complains that Meri has wandered off. INTERESTING! HALIMA MUST BE KILLING THESE WOMEN! Because, Selame is gone too! OH OH! There are rumors that Mattin Stepaneos was either killed by Rand or kidnapped. Siuan thinks there is an odd pattern among the Sitters. The Sitters chosen in Salidar are too young. After Romanda and Moria, Escaralde is the oldest and she is about seventy. The Hall has rarely had more than one Sitter under a hundred, but in Salidar, "here we have eight." OH OH! Romanda comes in and tells Egwene that she found out about the Pelivar and Arathelle and tells Eg that she must delegate to Romanda to talking. Then Romanda leaves and Lelaine enters with an identical message. The Hall was told about Egwene's plot. Siuan returns and confirms that everyone now knows. I really wanted Egwene to kill Romanda and Lelaine lol. They're treating Egwene very poorly. 
</p>
    
<p>
    Sheriam. Now, Sheriam is shielded and beaten because she doesn't know Eg's plan. She wishes she never spoke to a sister in the Hall. HALIMA?! 
</p>

    Ch 17
    Out on the Ice, Flame of Tar Valon
    Egwene. GO EGWENE! I appreciate this chapter and also, GO OFF RJ! Detailing every little thing.. *chef's kiss*. SO GOOD. Eg rides Daishar with the Hall and their Warder, Sheriam, SIuan, Bryne, a thousand soldiers, and UNO! It is the day of the Feast of Abram. Delana brings Halima. Eg wears clothes and jewels provided by Romanda, Lelaine, and Janya. Siuan rides Bela. Sheriam rides Wing, and Bryne rides Traveler. Let me just say I'm tired of hearing this bickering between Romanda and Lelaine and Egwene. It's annoying. Anytime their names come up.. I cring lol. Anyway, they all rive at the meeting place a frozen lake. The Murandians and Andorans are on the north side. Talmanes and a hundred Redarms are also there on the east side. They meet IN THE CENTER OF THE FROZEN LAKE?! THAT IS SO COOL! lol. In attendence: Arathelle, High Seat of House Ranshar. Pelivar, High Seat of House Coelan. Aemlyn, High Seat of House Carand and her husband Culhan, Donel do Morny a'Lordeine, Cian do Mehon a'Macansa, Patir do Fearna a'Conn and Segan do Avharin a'Roos. Whoa names lol. There are reports of Aes Sedai and Tower Guards sneaking into Andor. Eg speaks to the nobles promising them they will not enter Andor. They will remain in Murandy for a month then leave. The Andorans agree but will leave their armies. Eg announces that the novice book is now open for women of any age! 
</p>
    
<p>
    So, these Aes Sedai and Tower Guards in Andor.. this the crew going to the Black Tower??

    A Peculiar Calling, Dice
    Egwene. Well I love ta'veren, as a magic system. I love it how it works and its so cool this ta'veren pull! SO COOL. ALright, nobles talk to the Sitter. Eg pulls Sheriam away from Donal to have her ask about the sisters in Andor. Eg sends Siuan on the same mission. Rom and Lel look agnry. Segan asks if Eg was serious about the Novice book - she looks excited! Eg sees Talmanes talking to Pelivar and Eg goes to talk to Talmanes. Halima and Siuan watch as they talk. Talm tells Eg that he and others in the Band feel Mat needs them in the south.. SO COOL. Talm asks where Mat is. Eg implies that he is heading to Andor. Talm wants to stay behind in Murandy - King Roedran wants to hire the Band to help him consolidate Murandy. Eg agrees as long as Talm agrees not to get involved in a war. Donel talks with Janya and Moria. Cian talks with Takima. All the women end up asking Eg about the novice book including Negara (Andoran) Jennet (Murandian) and one of the Aes Sedai servants Nildra. Eg talks with Pelivar and he isn't excited about Elayne being Queen - Eg is frustrated because of men.. lol. The Aes Sedai prepare to return to their camp. Something is about to happen.

    The Law, Wheel and Snake
    Egwene. OH OH OH OH! EGWENE HECK YES EGWENE! OMG I'M FIST PUMPING AT MY DESK RIGHT NOW! YES YES YES! "In one month, we will begin the seige of Tar Valon". YES YES YES. I'm so excited. Alright, let's do this. Eg, Sheriam, Siuan, and Bryne lead the Sitters back to the camp. Delana and Halima stil chatting.. Bryne talks to Eg and says she has 30,000 men behind her. Siaun and Sheriam learned nothing about the sisters in Andor. Sheriam calls the Hall to sit. The Pavilion that is normally reserved for Skimming to Salidar to pick up e+e messages then Traveling back. Chesa brings Eg and SIuan dinner. Siuan loves Bryne, Eg thinks Bryne loves her back - Siuan remembers Min's viewing that Siuan needs to stay near Bryne. The Hall is ready... here we go! As soon as the meeting starts Eg calls for a vote to declare war on.. ELAIDA. Eg informs the Rom and Lel about that Laws of War and that it is STRICT! Janya asks Takima, an expert on law to confirm - she does. Eg is relieved that Takima is coorperating. Eg talks about Logain and reminds the Hall of Pelivar, Arathelle, and Aemlyn and how they aren't treating them like real Sitters. The vote is called - Janya stands first and nine others follow.. Eg thinks she has lost but Moria shouts at Lel about her lack of resolve and then Lel and Lyrelle stand and the lesser consensus is achieved and war is... DECLARED! Romanda tries to interrupt for a greater concensus but Eg asks Takima and the Law of War says once war is declared the Hall must approve all decrees by the Amyrlin. Eg has won - Delana pukes. Eg announces they will Travel in one month to begin the seige on TV!!!!!!!! Eg thinks she will elave her own legacy. AND HECK YES YOU WILL! I'M A FULL EG STAN NOW. OMG. EGWENE YES.

    Ch 20
    Into Andor, Caemlyn
    Elayne. This book is gooooood! I'm loving it now. Alright let's go! I want to read more today! Nynaeve Heals Avi, Elayne, Birgitte's wounds. Lan thinks Birgitte is Kandori because of her clothes. Elayne gets a new horse, Fireheart. There are eight Aes Sedai in their party. They pass through a bunch of villages and hear rumors about the Dragon Reborn. At Forel Market and old carpenter tells her that the DR is bringing El to Caemlyn. She hears more rumors that Rand swore fealty to Elaida and is now King of Illian. Ispan continues to grow meeker to Ad and Van questioning. Van thinks she's sworn an Oath not to talk about her cohorts. They found no more angreal in the stash and El studies the ter'angreal they found. Spirit is the safest to use. The glass blacksmith's puzzle leaves her dizzy and unable to sleep. Fire touching the metal helmet gives everyone but her a blinding headache. The red rod knocks her out for half the night and does something very embarrassing. What could she have done?!?!?! They then stay at an inn, the Wild Boar (DISCORD CHANNEL NAME! WOO!) - Merilille is now teaching the Windfinders. It's been nine days since they left Ebou Dar - it's raining. Then ehavy rain keeps them at the White Swan in Forel Market then it snows - Aviendha produces a sack of gems to buy warm clothes for everyone. Which means - snow - Renaile pronounces the bargain is complete and demands the Bowl and Merilille. After sixteen days on the road (full moon) they stay at the New Plow - Birgitte and Avi stand watch, Nynaeve and Elayne enter TAR. In TAR they go to the Am Study in the Little Tower in Salidar and they find a message from Eg "Stay in Caemlyn, keep silent and be careful". They leave a message in return that they will be there in about 15 days. Ominous note at the end.. "three days later the first explosion comes". WHAT COULD THAT BE?!

    Answering the Summons, Dragon
    Rand. Oh this is going to be awesome. Alright.. Charl Gedwyn is "Sotm Leader", Manel Rochaid is "Attack Leader". There are eight Dedicated and forty Soldiers. LTT Mutters about killing the Asha'man. In Rand's dreams he sees himself as LTT and sometimes as another blurred but familiar face. The face seems to surprise LTT as well. Rand opens a gateway - and gets very dizzy - to the North of Illian near the Causeway of the Northern Star and Travels with a large group including Marcolin, Weiramon, Maraconn, Gueyam, Aracome, Gregorin, three Council of Nine, Semaradrid, Dashiva, Flinn, Adley, and all the Asha'man except Narishma (who hasn't returned). Semaradrid's house has alliance with House Riatin. He is accompanied by Eagon Padros and other Illianers who followed Sammael. Rand sends Morr into the city and the rest make camp. Rand is thinking about his plans - he wants to get back to Cairien to deal with the Sea Folk and Cadsuane, he wonders about Caraline and Darlin, he thinks about Mat and Elayne and how they're *in Murandy with the Salidar Aes Sedai* and he really wants to talk with Nynaeve about cleansing saidin. Narishma returns with a bundle (THE.. oh I'm bad at this, the ter'angreal for the sa'angreal statues? - I'm confused on the name of the small statues lol). Narishma is angry because Rand didn't tell him everything but Rand insists he did... uh oh Rand. Now a thousand men of the Legion join them from Illian. Dashiva opens a gateway to the Silver Road east of the Nemarellin Mountains. The Silver Road runs north to Lugard and the Gold Road runs north to Far Madding. Rand sends most of the Asha'man out to gather additional forces, but because of the weather it takes several days. Arrivals include High Lords Sunamon and Torean, Bertome Saighan (Colavaere's cousin) and Ailil Riatin (Toram Riatin's sister) of Cairhien, Dalthanes Annallin, Amondrid Osiellin, Doressin Chuliandred who supported Colavaere, each with fifty to a hundred retainers, and High Lady Anaiyella. Finally, after eight days, Davram Bashere arrives. When Bashere asks, Rand explains that he would rather pay the butcher's bill with enemies than with friends. HERE WE GO!

    Gathering Clouds, A'dam
    Rand. Oh yes, here we go. Rand and six thousand men prepare to Travel. Jak Masond lead the Leagion. Gedwyn and Rochaid lead the Asha'man including Flinn, Dashiva, Adley, Hopwill, Morr, and Narishma. One of the Dedicated, grizzled with a countryman's face and a Tairen beard looks familiar to Rand. The Asha'man open nine gateways into the Venir Mountains in Altara. The Asha'man continue to Travel short distances searching for Seanchan forces. They pass the statue seen in the cover art; Bashere thinks it was a queen of Shiota. It is too worn for Eharon. An archer tries to kill Rand, but misses. Saidin is so foul here that Rand pukes. Gedwyn and Rochaid fry the archer who turns out to be Eagan Padros with thirty Tar Valon crowns in his pocket. Flinn and Narishma ride up. Flinn is now stronger than Gedwyn or Rochaid and Narishma is not far behind. An Asha'man returns to report the first sighting of Seanchan. WHAT IS HAPPENING?!
</p>
    
<p>
    Assid. Assid Bakuun a Seanchan solider for thirty years surveyed his camp. He has a wolfhoud named Nip. At the sul'dam's tent Nerith is braiding her damane's hair. The damane are recovering from their illness now that they are away from Ebou Dar. What is their illness?? Maybe trying to use stolen ter'angreal? or maybe the Bowl? Assid's first liet, Tiras brings a message delivered by raken that there is a large force ten miles to the east. Assid missed the end of the *Consolidation* by two hundred years, but remembers quelling a rebellion in Marendalar. He orders the campt struck so they can move into the hills.

    Ch 23
    Fog of War, Storm of Battle, Seanchan
    Rand. Rand and crew had their first skirmish with the Seanchan and won. But, lost 50 men in the process. Aracome is dead. Gedwyn has the Asha'man bringing supply carts. Tairen, Cairhienin, and Illianers are mingling now. Semaradrid is with Gueyam and Maraconn is with Kiril Drapaneos. Flinn, Adley, Morr and Hopwil are with the wounded. Rand, Narishma and Dashiva are poor at Healing. Gedwyn and Rochaid are talking. Bashere consoles Rand about how they'll do better next time. Bashere's patrol caught Nerith. Her damane, Gille was killed. Rand wants to hand Nerith over to Aes Sedai of his choosing and she runs and screams. Varil Nensen gateways in - Rand remembers seeing him at the Black Tower the first day he gave out pins to Taim and the others - and reports the Seanchan are thirty miles west. 
</p>
    
<p>
    Furyk. Kuryk Karede of the Deathwatch Guard (awesome name). There are 2000+ men and twelve sul'dam. According to his family, an ancestor of his accompanied Luthair Paendrag to Seanchan at Artur Hawkwings's command. There are lots of patrols of raken and morat'torm scouting. Twho of his officers are Jadranka and Nadoc. They think the force against them is at least 40000+. Suddenly the ground explodes around them as they're attacked. Jadranka foolishly orders a counterattack and Karede cuts his throat and orders Nadoc to rally and fall back. He orders Anghar to ride east and report. He suspects HL Suroth in Ebou Dar knows what's going on. 
</p>
    
<p>
    Rand. Whoa. The group has been fighting for five days. Rand is on a ridge with Dashiva, Flinn, Ailil, and Anaiyella. The rest are in the valley fighting. There have been three hundred casualies. A gateway opens and a solder Rlen Nalaam brings a sul'dam prisoner. He complains saidin feels strange. Flinn, Narishma, Hopwil, and Morr say the same. There are twenty-three sul'dam and two damane prisoner. Rand sends Flinn and Dashiva with orders for Gedwyn to push harder. They are concerned about Rand being alone but he's got some armsmen of Denharad and Ailil's and Anaiyella's. Weiramon is to the north and Bashere to the south. Then Rand is hit in the arm with a crossbow bolt and Seanchan attack from the north. The armsmen fight back and Ailil and Anaiyella huddle over rand and Rand can't decide if they want to protect or kill him. Bashere and Gregorin arrive from the south and Morr Heals Rand. Weiramon arrives, still clean. He claims he saw Seanchan advancing on the ridge so he left his post. Gedwyn arrives and says the Seanchan are falling back - Rand and crew have won. Weiramon and Gedwyn want to press onto Ebou Dar. Bashere and Gregorin recommend stopping.

    Ch 24
    A Time for Iron, Dragon
    Kennar. This is going to be a long one. Captain General Kennar Miraj. I want to know what Luthair Peandrag Power was using - was it the True Power?? Kennar mentioned that this new power is *corrupted* but LP was using something that wasn't corrupted. Does that mean this person was using the TP or was LP just a Forsaken in disguise and they had access to the DO?? Whoa.. Anyway, Suroth is here - from Ebou Dar with Alwhin and two da'covale - both appear ageless, and one is Liandrin!!! WHOA! Miraj notes with some surprise that the second who is short, dark-haired, slim and pale-eyed, is leashed as damane. WHO?? Suroth tells Kennar that there are only a few thousand troops and fifty Asha'man and they are Travelling. She orders him to wipe them out. Miraj wonders about her source of info. Kennar asks for sul'dam and damane and assurances that they are no longer sick... why are they sick?? She gives him the damane but doesn't assure them they are not sick.
</p>
    
<p>
    Rand. What is going on with saidin?! This is a day after ch 23, after Rand was wounded. LTT is becoming more distant. Dashiva, Flinn, Hopwil, Morr, Narishma, Gedwyn, and Rochaid hold gateways as the army pours through. Rand wants everyone to stick to the plan. Dashiva rides up to rand and weaves a barrier against eavesdropping, he tells Rand that saidin is misbehaving. His weave vibrates instead of holding steady. Rand belittles the problem and Dashiva gets angry - Rand wishes Herid Fel were still alive to help with the answer. Nalaam gateways in and gives a report that the Seanchan are on the march only five miles away. What is going on with saidin??
</p>
    
<p>
    Kennar. Here we go. We about to get a battle! A BIG ONE! He is accompanied by Abaldar Yulan, one of his captains, and Lisaine Jarath, his senior der'sul'dam. He has at least twenty damane and sul'dam. An under-lieutenant, Varek, reports that the enemy is only five miles east. Miraj issues orders to prepare for attack.
</p>
    
<p>
    Bertome. We are getting a lot of pov's in this chapter, we still have chapters left y'all! What is about to go down?! Bertome prapares to fight the Tarbon attack - there are two thosand Tarabon with sul'dam and damane. Here we go!
</p>
    
<p>
    Varek. What is going on?! Varek has an urgent mesage from Banner-General Chianmai from Miraj, an order to pull back. Varek thinks this is worse than Falme. He finds Chianmai dead, accidentally killed when the damane, Zakai had her channeling go out fo control... WHAT IS HAPPENING?! Varek takes charge of the survivors and orders them to head south. 
</p>
    
<p>
    Bashere. Bashere is with Gueyam, Amondrid, Jeordwyn Semaris, and Rochaid. A third of Bashere's men and two of the seven Asha'man are dead. Rochaid acts worried. The Asha'man are becoming slow and hesistant in their attacks. That's gotta be more for the saidin feeling odd than the damane.. gotta be. 
</p>
    
<p>
    Rand. So Callandor was what Narishma brought.. which means Narishma is now called to follow Rand.. I'm trying to remember what Rand's wards were on Callandor (any help??). Anyways, Rand is with Adley who lost control of saidin killing a bunch of Ailil's and Anaiyella's men. Bashere says there are ten to fifteen thousand soliders and maybe a hundred damane nearby. Rand says not even the Forsaken stand against the Dragon Reborn and Dashiva flinches.. Rand draws Callandor and channels Wind, Water, and Fire and lightning destroys the entire area. Despite Asmodean's teaching, Rand often does not know what he is doing when he channels. Rand loses control and kills men on both sides and Adley is killed. Bashere tackles Rand to the ground and Rand orders a retreat no knowing whether he won or lost. 
</p>
    
<p>
    Abaldar. Abaldar Yulan covers Miraj's body and orders a retreat back to Ebou Dar. This is the second devastiting defeat for the Seanchan. He will have to apoplogize to Suroth and the Empress. So Rand won! but at what cost Rand... at what cost?!

    Ch 25
    An Unwelcome Return, Darkfriend Women
    Elaida. Elaida is meeting with siz Sitters (because of course Blue's don't exist to Elaida) - Duhara (Red), Velina (White), Shevan (Brown), Andaya (Gray), Rubine (Green), and Sedore (Yellow). Shevan wears a dress of dark golden silk.. that might be important in the next perspective!! I read this whole chapter then came back to write notes. Elaida is annoyed that everyone in the WT knows about Forkroot now lol. The Sitters discuss the Seanchan taking Amador and Ebou Dar - the Salidar Aes SEdai in Murandy and Rand taking Illian. Velina (Whtie) doesn't believe in stories of the a'dam. They don't know where Darlin, Caraline, or Toram Riatin are hiding. Elaida threatens to send them to Silviana - Elaida already expelled two Sitters. Alivarin enters after *being gone for two weeks* (TRAVELLING!), Velina flinches.. hmm. Elaida still wants to charge Alviarin with treason. Elaida hopes Toveine will succeed in taking the BT. Alviarin orders Elaida to sign a decree acknowledging Rand as DR and anyone who approaches him needs to go through the WT or be branded as trators to the Light. Rand is also granted protection from the WT. Alviarin leaves and Silviana enters wearing a red-fringed shawl to administer punishment that Avliarin ordered. 
</p>
    
<p>
    Alviarin. Mesaana is here disguises and orders Alviarin to investigate why all the heads of the Ajahs, except the Red, are meeting in secret. Mesaana thinks Galina was killed. Galina was the only Ajah head who is Black, however there are Black Ajah sisters among the Sitters. Ferane Neheran and Suana Dragand are the only Sitters who are actually heads of their Ajah. While kissing Mesaana's hem, Alv notices a dress of bronze silk with black scrollwork that Mesaana is wearing - and Alv realizes Mesaana doesn't know everything... OH OH!
</p>

    Ch 26
    The Extra Bit, Dragon Fang
    Seaine. Some fun names here... lol. Anyway, this is awesome! Seaine is searching the White Tower for Zerah Dacan. The Ajah's are distant from each other, even the Sitters. Talene glares at Seanie (now we know why), Juilaine Madome, a Brown Sitter less than a year, snubs her.. Saerin Asnobar (Brown) scowls at her. Seaine finds Zerah and takes her to the lowest level of the WT. Pevara is there with an Oath Rod. Seaine and Pevara start reswearing the oaths - swearing on the Oath Rod causes Seaine's skin to feel too tight. They shield Zerah and force her to reswear the oaths and to swear to obe them. Zerah says she came to the WT from the north riding from the Erinin River to Jualdhe, but she has some cockleburs from the south - Zerah admits she came from Salidar. She truly believes that the Reds setup Logain. Zerah nearly chokes to death when Pevara tells her to admit it is a lie. Zerah gives them the names of the other nine moles including Bernaile, the other White. They send Zerah away. Then Saerin, Talene, Yukiri, and Doesine come in. They question Saerin and Pevara and they see the Oath Rod and Saerin picks up the AR and reswears the oaths adding she is not a Darkfriend. Then they all do except... TALENE! SHE REFUSES!
</p>
    
<p>
    Toveine. Holy smokes! LOGAIN! AND LOGAIN BONDED THIS TOVEINE AND IT WASN'T HIS FIRST BONDING!?! WHAT IS GOING ON AT THE BLACK TOWER?! This book is freaking awesome. OH WOW. Okay, Toveine, together wtih four other Red Ajah including Jenare and Lemai, and fifty soldiers ride through Andor. There are nine other identical parties converging on the BT. Toveine had been exiled to a farm in the Black Hills run by Mistress Jara Doweel. Toveine resents Elaida because she escaped without punishment even though she took part in the Red Ajah's ilicit activites.. pretty boys. Then Toveine and thre Reds are trapped and shielded by a group of Asha'man including Hardlin, Norley, Kajima, Vinchova, and led by Logain! Logain is a full Asha'man! He bonds Toveine, his second ;). Vinchova thinks Taim doesn't approve of the bonding, Logain thinks Taim would rather see him dead. WOW WOW WOW!

    Ch 27
    The Bargain, Cairhien Sun
    Min. Min! Alright, Min is in the Sun Palace Throne Room with Herid Fel's book in the hope of learning why he was killed. Sorilea has been grilling Min about Rand. Cadsuane has been in the palace a lot making Min nervous. Rand comes in. He is showing some of LTT's mannerisms. Min is angry about the letters she got from Rand and Rand tells her that Jonan Adley is dead because Rand killed him. Dobraine enters to report to Rand that Toram Riatin has disappeared. Fain, Hanlon are rumored to have deserted. Alil, Bertome, ANaiyella, Weiramon, and the other nobles have settled into the palace. Caraline and Darlin are guests/prisoners of Cadsuane at Lady Arilyn's palace. Min believes Caraline will support Elayne for the Sun Throne. Then Min thinks about Darlin being king and Darlin wil die in bed. Merana and Rafela enter and tell Rand about the Bargain with the Sea Folk. Harine (..) speaking for the Mistress of the Ships, Nesta (..) agrees to provide Rand with ships. But Rand will not change any of their laws and greant them a square mileof land at all ports, keeping a SF ambassador with him. Harine will be ambassador with her WF and Swordmaster and a retinue. Rand is angry but Merana yells at Rand for leaving them. Merana kept the details from Cadsuane and Rand asks Min to ask the Maidens to summon Cadsuane. Rand and Min are in his bedroom and Somara, Nesair, and Nandera enter and beat up Rand for dishonoring the Maidens. Daigian Moseneillin enters and tells Rand that Cadsuane is too busy. Whoa! 
</p>
    
<p>
    Rand. Oh heck, Callandor is flawed! Do we trust Cadsuane? Maybe. Let's do this - Rand prepares to visit Cadsuane instead. He can feel Alanna. Her presence in his mind reminds him of the cost of carelessness. He orders Narishma to guard his apartments while Nandera leads him, Dashiva, Flinn, Morr, and Hopwil to Cadsuane. They pass Ailil, Anaiyella, and Bertome on the way. Nandera leaves and Rand and the Asha'man enter the room - LTT flees as soon as he sees Cadsuane. They make a threatening scene, but Cadsuane ignores them. Rand tells the Asha'man to wait outside. He tells her he wants her to be his advisor but she refuses. He offers again. She says she will under conditions - he must listen to her, not lie to her, and be polite. In return, she promises she will not force him to do anything, she will not pry too much, and whatever she does will be for his good alone. He is angry at the conditions and starts to leave. As he does, she says she heard that Callandor has disappeared and warns him it is flawed. She did some research when she first suspected he was born. It lacks the standard safety buffer and magnifies the taint so it can only be used safely by a circle of a man and two women. WHY?! AND two women... Nynaeve and Elayne?! That'd be neat. She demands an apology as he walks out. Rand had hoped to use Callandor one more time. Now he has only one other chance. 
</p>

    Ch 28
    Crimsonthorn, Forsnaken
    Elayne. Pour one out for Adeleas.. Could it have been one of these Kin who fled the WT?? OH OH! I hadn't thought of that until right now. Let's go - The explosion comes in a moderate size villiage Harlon Bridge. The weather is starting to look nice and Mistress Dill, the inkeeper is nice. Adeleas comes up dragging Gernia Rosoinde by her arm and says this is actually Zarya Alkaese, a novice who ran away just before Vandene and Ad retired. She and Careane were novies together for two years. Tower law says she must become a novice again. Kirstian Chalwin breaks down and admits she ran away as a novice almost three hundred years ago - when they are told to put on white Sarainya Vostovan and Asra almost start a rebellion among the Kin. Reanne and Alise stamp that out. Nine days later, at Cullen's Crossing, Kirstian enters telling Ny, El, Avi, and Birg that Lan summoned them. Adeleas and Ispan are dead. They were drugged with Cimsonthorn in their tea, then Adeleas' thoat was slit and a stake was driven through Ispan's chest. Vandene arives and says since Ad accepted the tea, the killer was both a Darkfriend and someone Ad knew and trusted. Jaem guards the door as Vandene breaks down. Two days later the party enters Caemlyn and the Royal Palace.. THIS IS AWESOME! Elayne pronounces her claim for the throne by right of descent from Ishara. Elayne leaves her companions with Reene Harfor and goes to the Grand Hall with the Lion Throne. Dyelin is there, and she is with House Trakand.. woo! She still has Naean and Elenia locked up. Elenia's husband Jarid still supports her. Arymilla has laid a claim but few support her. The biggest threats are Aemlyn, Arathelle and Pelivar. Luan and Ellorien support Elayne, but may switch. They were all supporters of Morgase. Pelivar has daughters of age, but Luan has only very young granddaughters. Dyelin says the five support her. Dyelin asks Elayne what she will do about the Dragon Reborn. Elayne tells her she will bond him as Warder and marry him. She goes on to tell her plans for Andor and Dyelin laughs. THIS IS AN AWESOME BOOK!
</p>
    
<p>
    Daved. WHOA! This was gruesome. Daved rides into Caemlyn. He saw Cairhien looted during the Aiel War. Following orders, he stables his horse at the Red Bull in the New City and walks to a merchant's house with the sigil - a red heart on a golden hand. In the basement he meets Lady Shiaine (which is Mili Skane - darkfriend and someone who talks with the Forsaken - she's from ACOS) whom Daved is ordered to obey. Carridin and Falion are bound to a table - Hanlon has never met them. Shiaine receives her orders from Moridin. Hanlon hasn't heard of Moridin. Daved received his orders from Mogi. Shiaine has a guard drown Carridin with brandy and threatens to do the same with Falion. Moridin shielded her, but set the shield to dissolve so she could obey Shiaine. Moridin gave Shiaine another Aes Sedai as well. Shiaine asks Hanlon if he would like to put his hands on a queen... he's excited. Nasty Darkfriends lol.
</p>

    Ch 29
    A Cup of Sleep, Dragon
    Min. Oh my gosh, who can we trust?! Rand is in the throne room with Min and Morr. Rand has been sulking since Taim brought news from Caemlyn that Elayne tore down his banners. Min says he has hardly mentioned Mat, but Rand replies that he is certain Mat is alive - nice! Sorilea brings five prisoner AS saying they have asked to serve Rand. Elza Penfell, Nesune Bihara, Sarene Nemdahl, Beldeine Nyram, and Erian Boroleos. Min sees: Beldeine bonding an Asha'man as Warder, Sarene will have a love affair, Nesune will be famous for founding a library, and all six will serve Rand each in their own fashion. Min tells Rand and they swear loyalty to him. Min wishes she could read a Fel book. Sorilea leaves and tells Rand that Cadsuane is back. Rand, Min, and Morr go to see her passing Somara and five other Maidens and there is a GREAT EXPLOSION! Min sees the Maidens are gone and the throne room and Rand's apartments are destroyed. Rand tells Morr to take Min to the servants' quarters and guard her with his life. WHAT THE HECK JUST HAPPENED?! Here we go! 
</p>
    
<p>
    Rand. WHAT?! Dashiva??? Rand felt saidin and wonders if the attack was Demandred or perhaps Asmo returned. The weave came from different directions. For an instant he sees a shimmering, unrecognizable face. LTT says he should have sent Illyena away. Alanna has been away from the palace all morning. Rand weaves Folded Light from Fire and Air rendering him invisible and begins to look for his attackers. He adds Somara to the list of women. Cadsuane passes by with six other AS that he doesn't recognize. Ailil looks out of a room and sees him Shalon is with her and Rand ties them up and shields them. From a balcony Rand sees Gedwyn, Rochaid, and Dashiva. Gedwyn says "...telling you I felt nothing. He's dead". Dashiva spots him and throws fireballs at him. Rand weaves a cocoon from Air, Fire, and Earth and then weaves Fire and Air to shoot something like a laster wire at his attackers.. what lol. Then Rand keeps looking and Rand feels a man channel enough for a gateway then spots Narishma and shoots a fireball at him. Narishma and Flinn refuse to come out and continue on - Rand then keeps looking... for hours. WHAT THE HECK IS GOING TO HAPPEN?!
</p>
    
<p>
    Min. Ohhh no, Fedwin Morr... so sad. Rand is in the cellar room with Min and Morr. Fedwin has gone mad and now has the mind of a small child. Rand broguth a large leather bag with all that he could salvage from his rooms. Min has the Crown of Swords. Taim comes and reports that Torval, Gedwyn, Rochaid, and Kisman have deserted. Rand gives a cup of poison to Fedwin. Rand tells Taim to add Dashiva to the list. Taim is surprised and angry. Rand tells Taim to leave and not come back. Rand will be *moving about* for awhile. Taim leaves and Rand and Min prepare to leave. 
</p>
    
<p>
    OH MY GOODNESS. THE BLACK TOWER. WHAT IS GOING TO HAPPEN?! I seriously expect this to be like Order 66, where one moment all is well and then boom - it's the black tower AGAINST Rand. But Taim seems genuine.. I just don't know.
</p>

    Ch 30
    Beginnings, Wolf
    Perrin. Y'know, sometimes Perrin is awesome. 
    Perrin and crew (Neald, Grady, Balwer, Edarra, Carelle, Masuri, Seonid, their three Warder, Aram, and Elyas) are in Abila. Elyas and Aram don't like each other.Balwer takes off to see what he can learn and finds the house that the Propet is staying. Neald and the Warder stay with the horses. The rest are led to Masema. Hari, the man from the goatpen, is there with him. Perrin tells Masema that Rand sent him to top the killing and to bring Masema to him. Masema refuses to have anything to do with the OP but agrees to ride with Perrin. I love Perrin's line "I wonder how Masema feels about what Neald and Grady can do".. hahahahah
</p>
    
<p>
    Faile. Holy crap! The Shaido have captured Faile, Alliandre, Maighdin (Morgase), Alliandre, Bain, Chiad, Arrela, and Lacile! WHOA!
    Faile and Alliandre are out hawking, with Maig (morgase). Maighdin is sleeping with Tallanvor now, at least that's what Faile thinks. Bain and Chaid came with them but Suilin and the rest of the Maidens stayed at the camp. Twenty of Alliandres' soldiers and twetny Winged Guards are escorting them. Berelain is there. Parelean, Arrela, and Lacile ride up with news that Masema met with some Seanchan woman for four hours, four nights ago. Faile desprately wants someone to tell Perrin. Then the Shaido attack, Sevanna sent Efalin to get more gai'shain. An Aiel, Rolan, captures Fail. Swallow is killed. Parelean is killed. Alliandre, Maighdin (Morgase), Alliandre, Bain, Chiad, Arrela, and Lacile are captured. Only Berelain escapes to carry word to Perrin about the Seanchan, Masema, and the Shaido.. WHOA!
</p>
    
<p>
    Egwene. Oh yes, this has been an incredible book... WOOOO!
    Egwene is riding Daishar with the new recruits. She is accompanied by Siuan, Sheriam, and Chesa. Chesa is upset about the other two that have *disappeared*. These Aes Sedai have been recruiting for a month, the number of novices has doubled to almost a thousand! A grandmother named Sharina with a commanding presence might be stronger than Nynaeve! And Sharina seems like someone who might be important, since her name was mentioned a lot this chapter. Two Aes Sedai and the girls from Emond's Field joined two days ago. Bryne says his army is ready! Romanda and Lelaine still fight with each other. Thirteen sisters open a huge gateway to the plan below Dragonmount aand the army begings to march through to Tar Valon!! THIS IS AWESOME!
</p>

    Ch 31
    After, Wheel
    Rumors spreads across the land about the Dragon Reborn, the Asha'man, The Seanchan, and first is.... A CLASH OF ARMIES AT TAR VALON!! WOOOO!

    <h2>My Thoughts</h2>
    <p>Oh no, I struggled a bit with this book. Something that is holding this book up.. the prose and world building! Other than that.. not the best I've read so far. I tell you what, I am struggling with numbers. Does anyone care about numbers? Do you care if I like the book? Most of my reviews are 5/5 anyway, I love almost everything that I read or watch, so let’s talk categories.</p>

    <h2>Emotional Impact</h2>
    <p>This book was an easy read, but I just wasn't as impacted emotionally to this book. It was good, some good things happened, but it is hard to come close to Rand in the box or Dumai's Wells. </p>

    <h2>Characters</h2>
    <p>Nothing really stands out to me about any characters in particular. But, I will say - I'm pretty interested in a few characters. Cadsuane, an old Green Ajah Aes Sedai who won't stand down. The Watcher.. who I think is Ishamael back! The Asha'man, I'm so interested in learning more about them. Rand went through a lot this book, not as much as the last book, but he has a lot on his plate. I love Lan, I'm interested in his story with Nynaeve now. My love for Nynaeve went down a bit this book, but I'm still interested in her story. Mat, always a winner for me, was raped this book. And that was hard to read. He kept trying to brush it off, but he is hurting.</p> 

    <h2>Plot</h2>
    <p>Hmm. Seanchan have started to invade, we got that near the end. We've got the Bowl of the Winds. Nynaeve and Lan are married and Nynaeve has broken her block! Rand and Min made love.
