<h2>Written Review</h2>

<p>This is truly one of the greatest fantasy books ever written. I am utterly floored. The characters, the worldbuilding, and the prose are impecable. Absolutely astounding work here by Steven Erikson. And I have the pleasure of knowing this series is a finished 10 book series with other short stories and a seperate author completing storylines from this series, wow. I'm impressed.</p>

<p>This has been an awesome first impression for me of the Malazan world. I am reading every line on each page and every single letter is important so far. Good gracious is this so cool! Epic doesn't begin to cover this. The story here is that of mystery, magic, decite, gods, and so much more. I can't get over how awesome this story is. (also, i'm writing this at page 188 - January 19). I have SO MUCH MORE TO GO, I'M PUMPED!</p>
    
<p>Is this going to stunt my ability to enjoy other series after I read this? This is superb, incredible, awesome, epic. Ah, I can't get enough. </p>
    
<p>This story is grand and epic, and I really can’t wait to get back into this world. These characters are so visceral and real. This magic system is incredible deep and detailed. There is still so much to learn, we were given a litany of people, places, and things to keep track of in this entry and… wow. I LOVE IT. This book starts off with a list of character names and titles and groups, and in the back of the book there is a glossary of races and even more information. What an incredibly detailed world. </p>
    
<p>The plot was great as well, it kept me entertained and intrigued throughout. There was a mystery, and there was actually some humor in this absolutely brutal world. It was well paced, and a good through line. Each chapter had the viewpoints from many characters, some in the same scene while others were in a separate part of the world. It was AWESOME!!</p>
    
<p>I am planning on reading the whole series this year, ten books, but I might take breaks between each book because these are dense. I look forward to continuing the series!</p>

<h2>Started Reading</h2>
<p>I started reading this on January 8, 2024.</p>
