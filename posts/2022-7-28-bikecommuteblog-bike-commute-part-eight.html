    <h2 id="new-route">New Route</h2>
    <p>Today I took a new route! I rode with some friends from work, they were a delight to ride with. It was a beautiful ride: we took River Road instead of riding on Market Street. We bypassed all the traffic and stoplights for a beautifully scenic ride under the bridge.</p>

    <p>The ride was tough, but I enjoyed it.</p>

    <p>I'm taking my bike home with me today! Because... Monday should start my <strong>Bike Commuting To Work Officially</strong>!</p>
    
    <p>I'm nervous but I'm very excited.</p>
