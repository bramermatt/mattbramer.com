    <h2>Written Review</h2>
    <p>Another boom from Stephen King, and this is his FIRST PUBLISHED NOVEL?! Yes, this was an absolute dream. I must bring to attention that I listened to this novel. That might affect my scores or my review, but I really enjoyed this novel. </p>
    
    <p>I listened to this novel once before, early January last year, and this time was again another wonderful read. I just read The Shining by Stephen King and oh wow, Stephen King is something special.</p>
    
    <p>For most of my reading, lately, I have been reading Fantasy. So, horror is an interesting genre. Stephen King feels like his very own genre. But, I truly enjoy the Stephen King novels I’ve read so far. </p>
    
    <p>Carrie, the novel, is a very interesting design. This story, or reading, is a “recap”, and I feel that doesn’t truly describe this. The situation has occurred and the story we read is telling what happened. A very cool use of plot. </p>
    
    <p>These characters are very well described and designed. Great work again Stephen King. Also, another great example of the supernatural inside of the natural. And whoa, Carrie walking down the street... SCARY!</p>
    

    <h2>Spoilers Ahead</h2>
    <p>Be prepared for spoilers ahead!</p>

    <details id="scores">
        <summary>Review Scores</summary>
    <h2>Emotional Impact. 4.</h2>
    <p>I was on the edge of my seat from the first page. This is a story that is of an incident that has already happened, so things are described as “that happened and he died”, so that means that we know the “he” is going to die. But really, this was a good book!</p>
    
    
    <h2>Characters. 5.</h2>
    <p>Another great Stephen King example of real characters with real motivations.</p>
    
    
    <h2>Plot. 5.</h2>
    <p>Quick, exciting, smart.</p>
    
    
    <h2>Prose. 5.</h2>
    <p>Stephen King, real, smart, quick, excellent.</p>
    
    
    <h2>World Building. 4.</h2>
    <p>What I think about, when it comes to world building, is building the whole world. However, that isn’t always very necessary. This novel is very well described and tells what the world is like, and how things occur. This is a particular incident that is being explained, but still a good example of world building. </p>
    
    <h2>Total Scores 4/5</h2>
    <p>I am a huge fan of Stephen King, only after 2 novels. </p>

        <summary>Notes as I Listened</summary>
<h2>Part One: Blood Sport</h2>
<p>This is an absolutely amaze example of a character examination and how your Homelife can impact your daily life. Wow. I love the way this is a story told as the “thing” has already happened. </p>

<p>I am appreciative of how we see different perspectives of those who were there are who had interactions with Carrie. </p>

<p>Again, SK is doing it when it comes to bringing this supernatural to the natural. There is a section where a scientific explanation is given for the telekinesis. Whoa. </p>

<p>Oh this isn’t going to be good for Carrie, the pig blood. </p>

<h2>Part Two: Prom Night</h2>
<p>I love this. I LOVE THIS! </p>

<p>What happened? The devil came to Chamberlain. </p>

<p>Carrie walking down the street… SCARY!</p>

<p>AND DUDE, MARGARET WHITE’S DEATH?! HOLYYYYYYYY!</p>

<h2>Part Three: Wreckage</h2>
<p>Carrie is DEAD?!</p>

<p>Love a good ending with a possibility of future generations having tk!</p>
