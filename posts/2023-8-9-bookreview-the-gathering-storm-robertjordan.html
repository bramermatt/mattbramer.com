    <h2>Written Review</h2>
    <p>Oh yes, thank you Robert Jordan and Brandon Sanderson. If you've read Brandon Sanderson, you'll know how Brandon Sanderson likes to end his book... the Sanderlanch as it is called. And this book is NO EXCEPTION to that. Specially, I feel like Robert Jordan is the absolute master at backstory, build up, and world building. Brandon Sanderson is the absolute master at action, magic, pacing, and endings. I think The Wheel of Time was perfect for Brandon Sanderson. The Gathering Storm was an incredible starting point for Brandon Sanderson's Wheel of Time novels.</p>

    <p>Now, would you have known this book had a different writer than before? Honestly, I don't think so. There was an incredible entry in The Wheel of Time! WOW! So good. </p>

    <p>Some chapters were absolutely difficult to read, some made me jump with joy, some made me very emotional. This was a beautifully written and excellent book. </p>

    <h2>Started Reading</h2>
    <p>I have started reading this book on August 10, 2023.</p>

    <h2>Spoilers Ahead</h2>
    <p>I am saying these <a href="#notes">Notes as I Read</a> are going to be spoilers if you've not read The Gathering Storm yet! Please read at your own digression.</p>

    <details id="story">
    <summary>Spoiler Story Breakdown</summary>
    <p>Holy smokes, so much happened in this book.. oh this book was so good. Wow. </p>

    <h2>The Small Stuff</h2>
    <p><strong>Perrin</strong> after saving Faile is moving his army, which now includes a LOT of refugees from Malden. Perrin also tries to work in the Wolf Dream. I'm so interested in the Wolf Dream.</p>

    <p><strong>Faile</strong> killed Masema.</p>

    <p><strong>Mat</strong> misses Tuon and ends up in a village of Hinderstap, which has a bit of a strange situation that occurs after sunset - they basically become enraged and kill people and then the next day, it's all good. Verin also shows up to Mat. Verin agrees to take Mat and the Band to Caemlyn.</p>

    <p><strong>Aviendha</strong> ends up finally realizing that she is ready to be a Wise One. The Wise Ones send Aviendha to Rhuidean to complete her Wise One training.</p>

    <p><strong>Gawyn</strong> oh Gawyn. Gawyn seperated from his crew who killed Warders and learned about Egwene being captured in the White Tower. Gawyn goes to the Rebel Aes Sedai camp to help save Egwene. To be continued..</p>

    <p><strong>Siuan</strong> has bonded Gareth Bryne! Also to be continued.. </p>

    <p><strong>Tuon</strong> is now Empress. Tuon is now Fortuona, her new name. She met with Rand and ended up declaring he needs to kneel to her. He doesn't and Fortuona declares the Seanchan are going to attack the White Tower... to be continued..</p>


    <h2>Now the BIG STUFF</h2>

    <p><strong>Verin</strong> is BLACK AJAH. Yes, wow. Verin commits suicide, which she had to do to tell Egwene what was happening. The Dark One's oaths require, "I swear not to betray the Great Lord, to keep my secrets until the hour of my death." Verin has been an absolute awesome character, for me, since we met her. I was shocked when the reveal occured that she was Black Ajah, but she studied the Black Ajah as a mole. She gave Egwene a lifetime of research to Egwene, including all known members of the Black Ajah. I'm going to miss Verin. She also gives Egwene her blessing for Egwene being Amyrlin. So good. </p>


    <p><strong>Egwene</strong> is now reached one of my top 5 characters now! OH SO GOOD. Alright so Egwene was being beaten by the Mistress of Novices, Silviana, constantly as she is still telling people that Egwene is the true Amyrlin. Egwene is convincing Novices, Sitters, and as many people as she can to sew deceit toward Elaida. Egwene wants the Tower to be together. She also gets with the Black Ajah hunters and convinces them as well. Egwene also told the rebel Aes Sedai not to rescue her. And then the Seanchan attack the White Tower.</p>

    <p>Egwene stands up and unites Novices and Egwene gets a powerful ter'angreal and absolutely wrecks the Seanchan. Egwene is absolutely super powerful with this ter'angreal, and she gets very, very tired after helping stop the Seanchan. She ends up falling asleep and Gawyn ends up showing up with Siuan and Bryne and takes her away from the Tower.</p>

    <p>Egwene, in the rebel Aes Sedai camp, gathers the Hall together and tells them all about the Black Ajah list that Verin gave her, including Sheriam. Egwene and the rebel Aes Sedai are able to still and execute 50 of the 70 Black Ajah sisters, the rest fled. Egwene then says they need to finally siege the White Tower. Turns out there were some of the Heads of Ajahs from the White Tower that showed up at the opposite end of a bridge and told Egwene that they have decided that Egwene shall be raised as Amyrlin of the White Tower.</p>

    <p>Egwene is raised as Amyrlin of the White Tower, the rebel Aes Sedai are brought into the Tower, and Silviana (the Mistress of Novices that beat Egwene) is named Keeper of the Chronicals for Egwene. I loved this storyline.</p>

    <p><strong>Elaida</strong> is taken by the Seanchan and has been collared.</p>

    <p><strong>Rand</strong> oh yeah, whoa Rand had quite the storyline here. Rand is bringing together some of the Great Captains including Rodel Ituralde now, and Rand has tasked Ituralde to protect the Borderlands. Rand is gearing up for the Last Battle, and he is steamrolling his way to the Last Battle. This book brings Rand to breaking his feeling towards killing women, to also using balefire to kill Forsaken, to nearly killing Tam. A LOT HAPPENED FOR RAND THIS BOOK.</p>

    <p>Rand gets captured with the male a'dam by Semirhage, and Semirhage forces Rand to strangle Min. Then Rand feels that this can't be the end, and he feels for more power and finds... the True Power - the Power directly from the Dark One... WHAT?! Then weaves balefire using the True Power and deletes Semirhage and Elza from the Pattern. Previously, in this book Rand woke up in the TAR and spoke with Moridin (who is actually ISHAMAEL! I WAS RIGHT!), and realized that he was able to come back and decided that balefire is what is needed to kill the Forsaken so they won't come back. I have a Forsaken count later, it's important now that we are so close to the Last Battle!</p>

    <p>Later Rand finds out where Graendal is located, a palace known as Natrin's Barrow. Rand proceedes to balefire the ENTIRE PALACE, including every single person - servant - cook - janitor.. everyone inside. Two Forsaken killed by balefire this book, but also countless others. Rand got really dark this book.</p>

    <p>Rand later, after Cadsuane and Nynaeve brought Tam al'Thor to Rand, nearly kills Tam because Tam let slip that he was brought by Cadsuane; Rand weaved balefire to kill Tam then stopped himself. Then went on a mission to balefire the Tarasian Palace where Fortuona was staying.. it got dark. Then Rand ended up on Dragonmount in one of the most beautifully written chapters I've read.. Rand prepares to die, on Dragonmount like he (LTT) did 3,000 years ago, then realized the cycle of Rebirth means he has a chance to fix his mistakes. Rand uses the Choedan Kal to destroy the Choedan Kal instead of using it to destroy the world. And he laughs...</p>


    <p><strong>The Dark One</strong> is reaching out of the Pattern and ruining food and moving around hallways of places. We're building to the Last Battle.</p>


    <p><strong>The Forsaken</strong> some things occured during this book and there needs to be an updated Fosaken Count.. </p>

    <p><strong>Forsaken count: Forsaken killed by balefire this book: 2.</strong></p>

    <p><strong>Alive</strong></p>
    <ul>
    <li>Damandred</li>
    <li>Mesaana</li>
    <li>Lanfear / Cyndane</li>
    <li>Ishamael / Moridin</li>
    <li>Aginor / Halima / Aran'gar </li>
    <li>Moghedien</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>Balefired</strong></p>
    <ul>
    <li>Rahvin</li>
    <li>Semirhage</li>
    <li>Graendal</li>
    <li>Balthamel / Dashiva / Osan'gar</li>
    <li>Be'lal</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>Dead</strong></p>
    <ul>
    <li>Asmodeon</li>
    <li>Sammael (I THINK!)</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>The Black Ajah</strong> are still out there. A lot were able to escape from the White Tower after Egwene was raised Amyrlin, so I'm interested in finding out more of that. Also, this is also interesting about the Black Ajah Oaths.. "they serve the DO until the hour before their death".. I wonder if that is important.</p>

        <summary>Notes As I Read</summary>

        <h2>Header</h2>
    <p>"Ravens and crows. Rats. Mists and clouds. Insects and corruption. Strange events and odd occurrences. The ordinary twisted and strange. Wonders! The dead are beginning to walk, and some see them. Others do not, but more and more, we all fear the night. These have been our days. They rain upon us beneath a dead sky, crushing us with their fury, until as one we beg: "Let it begin!" —Journal of the Unknown Scholar, entry for The Feast of Freia, 1000 NE"</p>

    <h2>Prologue, What the Storm Means, Wheel and Snake</h2>
    <p><strong>Renald Fanwar.</strong> Oh heck, this is why I love the Wheel of Time. A character we've never heard of before has an entire backstory that can be told in a few pages and we know what they're dealing with but they aren't exactly sure what's going on... so good! Renald Fanwar is a Borderlander farmer, seeing unnatural black and silver clouds come and go. His friend Gaffin thinks he's crazy. Thulin, a close blacksmith from Oak Water comes by in a loaded wagon with his wife Gallanha and daughter Mirala. They left everything behind and are "heading north". An army will be gathering and they need a smith. Renald's farmhands Merk, Favidan, Rinnin, Veshir, Adamad, and Geleni gather animals and provisions and Renald begins working his two best scythes into polearms... the storm is coming! THE LAST BATTLE AND THE GOLDEN CRANE FLIES FOR TARMON GAI'DON!</p>

    <p><strong>Falendre.</strong> Sul'dam who was at the attack on Rand (lost his hand). After the debacle with the Dragon Reborn, the reremaining sul'dam and damane, Falendre and Nenci, Surya and Tabi, Malian, Ciar, and Talha have been moved via gateway to the Ebou Dar road outside the city. The bodies of Tanera and Miri are tied across horses. Nynaeve, Cadsuane, Merise and Logain are there, among others. Falendre is still trying to grasp the idea that Anath was really one of the Forsaken. Rand orders Falendre to take a message to the Daughter of the Nine Moons that he still wants a meeting. He will be in Arad Doman quelling the fighting against the Seanchan there.</p>

    <p><strong>Tylee.</strong> Hey hey, Tylee's pretty good with that sword! Taking a Trolloc out.. nice! So, Tylee (Seanchan Lieutenant General Tylee Khirgan) who fought with Perrin against the Aiel to get Faile.. lol She is a day away from Ebou Dar, she is from Maram Kashor, her ancestors might have come from here with Luthair Paendrag, she thinks. She lost few soldiers at Malden with Perrin's plan, because it worked so well. Ghosts are beeing seen, Karm the quatermaster, reported that a pack of rations turned to dust. Tylee thinks they are focusing on the wrong enemy. Galgan and Suroth have a single purpose, until Tuon unveils! Then a barbed arrow takes out Mishima and hundreds of Trollocs attack!</p>

    <p><strong>Graendal.</strong> ahh the plots! Graendal is in a palace in Arad Doman, right, at least that is what I'm to understand. Another hint that Sammael is actually dead, I don't know when I'll actually believe that lol. Graendal goes through the provided gateway to a black stone fortress in the deep northeastern Blight, she cools herself with Air and Water (weaves). Demandred and Mesaana enter - Mesaana is in the White Tower. She gets information from her agents in the White Tower and from Aran'gar with the rebels. Moridin spends his time gathering forces for the Last Battle while Moghedien and Cyndane rally Darkfriends to kill Mat and Perrin. She knows Semirhage is with the Seanchan so she knows the plans for everyone except Demandred. She thinks she would have heard from her spies if he were with the Borderlanders. Moridin enters.</p>

    <p>Demandred and Mesaana want to free Semi from Rand. Moridin says no. HOLY SMOKES. Mesaana must've had a spy at the Semi meeting, Moridin says she failed to capture him and disobeyed orders in harming him so no rescue. THEN MORIDIN FLEXES HIS LEFT HAND!! LATER GRAENDAL SAYS MORIDIN LOOKS LIKE RAND IF HE STANDS A CERTAIN WAY!! So my prediction is Moridin / Ishi are the other that Rand sees in his mind... since the balefire crossing? But I don't have more info than that, but that is interesting Moridin flexes his left hand.... that nugget has been tucked away.</p>

    <p>Mesaana says the WT is nearly broken and Demandred says his rule is secure. Moridin and Graendal talk and says her presence was a reward for her good work - Rand is coming to AD to restore order, she is to prevent that, not to harm him but bring pain of heart, frustration and anguish.</p>

    <p><strong>Rodel Ituralde.</strong> OH WHOA! Ituralde prepares to face a SC army of 150,000 outside the city of Darluna. Lidirn, an offer, is with him after Jaalam Nishur was killed in one of their last battles. Ituralde was dressed as a farmer to fool the C, Ituralde would have thought Darluna a grand city before he wne to fight the Aiel at Tar Valon! WHOA! SC army falls for the trap and Ituralde attacks!</p>

    <p><strong>The Prophet.</strong> DANG FAILE. DANG. Masema is with his remaining followers on a cliff near Malden, he is convinced Perrin is Shadowspawn. He thinks the Lord Dragon appeared to him last night and ordered him to kill Perrin. Prediction.. that wasn't actually Rand lol. Probably a Forsaken or maybe even Taim that Darkfriend..... Masema plans to escape from Perrin and rebuild. Faile and her Cha Faile show and Faile orders her bowmen to fire.. Masema is wounded and Faile stapbs Masema in the heart while she orders her followers to make sure that Perrin doesn't find out. WHOA!</p>

    <h2>Ch 1, Tears from Steel, Dragon</h2>
    <p><strong>Rand.</strong> Whoa. This was HARD TO READ. Rand is losing control, and I feel so bad for him. This is so tough. That is interesting that the female channelers didn't help LTT..</p>

    <p>A wind rises around the White Tower and passes over the Alindaer Bridge and the town of Alindaer. Nearby is the rebel army numbering 50,000 whose Amyrlin, Egwene al'Vere, is held by the White Tower. The wind passes Dragonmount and over the Black Hills and Caralain Grass to Arad Doman. A countering wind from the north brings a stench of death. Rand and Min are in a log manor house in far eastern Arad Doman. His eyes are slowly getting better. He thinks of himself as hard as steel. He has been moving a lot since Lord Algarin's manor was compromised. Bashere's army is camped on the green near the house. He wears an unusual sword recently unearthed.</p>

    <p>Rand can feel that Aviendha is coming closer. She is with Rhuarc. He can sense Elayne and Alanna as well. Elayne feels relieved. Lews Therin moans about Ilyena and Rand thinks about what Semirhage said while impersonating the Daughter of the Nine Moons. 10 Asha'man, but Flinn, Narishma, and Naeff are full AM. Ituralde has been effective. Rand wonders if Graendal is still in Arad Doman as Asmo told him. He doesn't know what became of Asmo. Rand's goal is to fulfill his answer from the Aelfinn, that he must unite the south and the west, the north and the east. He intends to bring peace to Arad Doman and make a truce with the Seanchan.</p>

    <p>Cadsuane arrives with Nynaeve and Alivia. Min stiffens when she sees Alivia, as she always does, because of her viewing that Alivia will help Rand die. They have been questioning Semirhage. Rand will not allow torture on a woman, even one of the Forsaken, so they have learned nothing. Cadsuane suggests turning her over to the White Tower and Rand asks which one, Elaida or Egwene? Lews Therin grumbles about the women Aes Sedai not helping him, then moans about Ilyena. Rand shouts at him out loud and the others in the room stare at him. Rand is losing control. There may be nothing left of him to fight at Shayol Ghul. He should cry, but tears cannot come from steel.</p>

    <h2>Ch 2, The Nature of Pain, Flame of TV</h2>
    <p><strong>Egwene.</strong> Sheesh. Elaida has gone off the deep end, maybe she is just showing off in front of Egwene... maybe. So, Egween is still getting spanked, a lot. She is trying to embrace the pain as the Aiel do. Katerine and Barasine meet her to escort her to attend Elaida, Alviarin comes to get her punishment but she is late. As they're walking, in WOT fasion BOOM there is a wall in the way lol. The corridor dead ends at a mural of Caraighan Maconar ending the rebellion in Mosadorin, another change in the Pattern.</p>

    <p>Egwene decides her best option to deal with Elaida is silence. This is her first look at Elaida since she, Elayne and Nynaeve left the Tower to hunt the Black Ajah. Meidani is there. Elaida has her researching punishments for traitors. She jokes about demoting Shemerin. She does not believe the Seanchan are a threat and talks of a fourth Oath of obedience. Infuriated, Egwene dumps the soup bowl to keep from reacting. Meidani helps clean up and Egwene orders Meidani to send for her. Meidani agrees.</p>

    <p>In a rage, Elaida sends her out. She goes to the novice dining hall for dinner where she can hear Laras in the kitchens. She now realizes that Elaida will eventually destroy herself with her arrogance. Egwene's job is to hold the Tower together and keep it whole. She feels urgency for the White Tower to provide guidance for Rand. She returns to Silviana for another spanking, intending to visit Leane afterwards. She laughs when she realizes the pain of spanking is nothing beside the pain of the White Tower crumbling. Embracing pain is not about being hard; it is about understanding its insignificance. She reminds Silviana that Elaida's misguided orders only carry weight if Sisters accept them.</p>

    <h2>Ch 3, The Ways of Honor, Aiel</h2>
    <p><strong>Aviendha.</strong> My guess, her punishment is for her not staying with the Wise Ones. It seems to me all the Wise Ones stay together, talk together, sweat together - Avi is just running around doing things that a Maiden would do. Ah, I don't really know. Just glad to get more explanation on the ji'e'toh. SO Aviendha's spears were what makes up Rand's belt buckle, I think we knew that - still very cool to read!</p>

    <p>Avi, Rhuarc, Heirn, adn five other Maidens and True Bloods are scouting Domani refugees, this is the tenth band in less than a week. Rhuarc and Dobraine secured Bandar Eban and now the Aiel are scouting between there and Rand's manor. Aviendha is confused about her honor; she is no longer a Maiden but not yet a Wise One. Now the Wise Ones will not teach her at all and give her punishments. As they progress to Rand's manor, they meet up with two hundred other Aiel including Amys, Bair, Melaine and Nadere. Bair is only recently arrived. Amys grills Aviendha about her opinions on their work and about Rand and Min. Amys nods in agreement with Aviendha's opinions. She then gives Aviendha useless labor suitable for da'tsang as a severe punishment.</p>

    <h2>Ch 4, Nightfall, Wheel and Snake</h2>
    <p><strong>Gawyn.</strong> Hey, if someone had asked me how the White Tower siege was going to start from the rebels.. it wouldn't have been Gawyn. BUT from what it seems like here, I presume Gawyn is going to show himself in this rebel AS camp, he's going to learn of Egwene's capture and FREAKING STORM THE TOWER! At least that's what I'd want to read lol.</p>

    <p>So, Gawyn is with Jisao, Raja and 50 other Younglings. The clouds are higher than Dragonmount. They are scouting Gareth Bryne's soldiers in a small village. The soldiers are searching villages looking for the Younglings. Gawyn is being cautious. He does not understand why Bryne is here instead of in Caemlyn protecting Elayne. Gawyn struggles with his loyalties to Egwene, Elayne and the White Tower. There are only three hundred Younglings. They still survive against 50,000 troops only because Gawyn is so familiar with Bryne's tactics. Gawyn wishes he could see the sun again.</p>

    <h2>Ch 5, A Tale of Blood, Sea Folk</h2>
    <p><strong>Rand.</strong> I love the Wheel of Time. SO MUCH. Wow, this is a weighty chapter. It took years for people to believe men were mad, not it might take longer for them to believe it's clean... and Rand thinks "is only a cleansed taint going to be all I leave the world with?" wow. Wow. SO! Rand is really paying attention to these colors swirling, he gets a full view of Mat dicing and some soliders near a large road outside a city (I guess Rand is seeing what he WOULD be seeing if he were there, it's not like a drone shot or something, but what he'd see). Tuon isn't with Mat anymore.</p>

    <p>A gateway opens in the Traveling Ground. An Asha'man soldier has a message from Darlin that his army is ready in Tear. Harine and several other Sea Folk come through the gateway. Logain mentioned that the Sea Folk were hesitant to return her to Rand. Rand complains that the ships are taking too long to arrive but Harine replies that the Seanchan caused the delays.</p>

    <p>Rand asks her what the Sea Folk do to men who can channel. They make a Bargain that if she answers, he will answer a question of hers. Harine says they are killed or left stranded on a small isle. Rand tells her that this must stop as saidin is now clean, but Harine remains skeptical. Rand thinks there might be another Jorlen Corbesan among those men. He was brilliant and ran the Sharom research facility in the Age of Legends, another memory from Lews Therin.</p>

    <p>Rand thinks Lews Therin will be able to help him figure out how to reseal the Bore. Flinn comes through the gateway. He apologizes that he is not as good at gateways as Androl. Rand asks Elza what she believes about the taint but she also hedges. Corele says that she can feel through Damer that it is clean. Elza points out that during the Time of Madness it took decades for people to be convinced that all male channelers would go mad. It will take long for people to really believe that that has now changed. Rand thinks that he is bound by the Pattern and has no choices. He wonders if he will leave anything behind but war and devastation. Last time his madness and grief at Ilyena consumed him. He thinks of Moiraine telling him that we all do as we must. A guard brings news that there are Aiel near the camp. Rand sends orders to Bashere that they will be meeting with Bael and Rhuarc to secure Arad Doman.</p>

    <p><strong>Cadsuane.</strong> Oh heck, Cadsuane is awesome lol. I dunno, I want to love her lol. Cadsuane has been using the OP to extend her years... interesting. Also I love that she says "if someone is old and says they're patience they're either lying or senile" hahahah.</p>

    <p>So Cadsuane, Merise and Narishma question Semirhage in a small room. Erian, Sarene and Nesune are outside the room holding her shield. Cadsuane is furious that Rand will only allow questioning and not torture. Merise asks about Graendal's plans. Semirhage intimidates Merise with a bloody tale so that she loses control of the session. Cadsuane stops the questioning, blocking Semirhage's ears with Air and her eyes with Fire and Air. Over two centuries ago Cadsuane swore she would live to see the Last Battle. Cadsuane wishes she had forkroot to be doubly safe with Semirhage. Merise composes herself and the questioning resumes, asking about Graendal and her whereabouts. Cadsuane believes that Rand is destined to destroy the world. He may save it as well. Cadsuane thinks on how to break Semirhage. Corele arrives with news that Rand is meeting with the clan chiefs and the questioning session ends.</p>

    <p>I have a feeling I'm going to love this book.</p>

    <h2>Ch 6, When Iron Melts, The PATTERN!</h2>
    <p><strong>Ituralde.</strong> I cannot wait to see what Ituralde does now. WOW. I am TERRIFIED OF ITURALDE lol. He's a beast.. love the writing here.. "Ituralde pulled out his sword--heron-maked--"... ugh, this is so good!</p>

    <p>SO! The battle at Darluna with Ituralde and the SC is over, Ituralde won, but half of his 100,000 soliders are dead. The SC were crushed against the walls of Darluna. They had three times as many soldiers, plus damane. Ituralde found General Turan near death and Turan is impressed with Ituralde, but he tells him that Suroth cannot accept his failure. Ituralde's trick won't work a second time. Ituralde knows he'll lose eventually, but he can't abandon his homeland even if defeat is certain. Perhaps memory of his fight will start a rebellion in 100 years. Turan asks for a quick death and Ituralde beheads him...</p>

    <p><strong>Leane.</strong> This is crazy! Egwene is talking with Leane (who truly believes she is Amyrlin now) and being guarded by Musarin and Gelarna (Yellows). When Egwene goes to leave the iron bars and stone floor turn as soft as wax and Leane begins to sink. Egwene screams for help and the two sisters pull her free with Air. Eg says the Dark One is getting stronger and asks what Elaida is doing about it - Eg tells Leane to stay strong and leaves.</p>

    <p><strong>Egwene.</strong> The DO's touch is becoming worse, Eg is walking towards the Novice quaters and then turns out it's the Brown Ajah quaters - the whole quaters have switched places seamlessly! Also, the Brown sisters are Maenadrin and Negaine.</p>

    <h2>Ch 7, The Plan for Arad Doman, Ornaments</h2>
    <p><strong>Nynaeve.</strong> I love my girl Nynaeve. This was cool to see her perspective on this meeting. SO! Nynaeve is being instructed by Daigian, weaeves. Nynaeve hasn't sworn on the Oath Rod, Daigian still feels the looss of her Warder Hopwil, but she won't allow an attempt at Healing. Nynave is glad the access key she used was destroyed, too much power for one person is a bad thing - Nynaeve thinks. She is glad Cadsuane hasn't given Rand the male access key.</p>

    <p>Nynaeve wonders if Rand is mad like Semirhage said. Finally Rhuarc and Bael arrive with Aviendha and other Wise Ones, Amys, Bair and Melaine. Rand unfairly chides them for not restoring order to Arad Doman yet. Bael says that Dobraine Taborwin has Bandar Eban under control, but Alsalam and the Council of Merchants have disappeared. Rand thinks Graendal may have him. Rand says they must bring peace and stop the fighting against the Seanchan to show good faith for his meeting with the Daughter of the Nine Moons. Rand will personally deal with Rodel Ituralde. He orders Rhuarc and Bael to find and hold the Members of the Council.</p>

    <h2>Ch 8, Clean Shirts, Rats</h2>
    <p><strong>Siuan.</strong> Oh now that was beautiful. I'm happy to see Siuan happy. I am excited we are getting more background on Siuan and bits and pieces about her quest for the Dragon Reborn. I have loved Siuan since she told Rand he was the Dragon Reborn (BOOK TWO.. WOW!). Siuan has been a little distant lately, but I think she's going to be a big part of this whole thing soon enough.</p>

    <p>Siuan heads for the army camp thinking that her quest for the Dragon Reborn has consumed her life. Moiraine died for it. She wonders if she should have switched to Green like Leane. She reaches Bryne's palisade. It is getting late and she is supposed to meet Egwene in Tel'aran'rhiod at dark. In Bryne's tent, they chide each other a bit, then Bryne asks her why she broke her oath. At first she hedges, saying she had to get information and Logain to Salidar.</p>

    <p>She breaks down and tells him the truth about the Foretelling of the Dragon Reborn and that Tamra was murdered by the Black Ajah. Now Moiraine is dead, too. Bryne tells her she needs to get to bed. He is aware of her meetings with Egwene every three days. She thinks he is insufferable, but beds down with the twisted ring.</p>

    <p>In Tel'aran'rhiod there is a violent but strangely silent storm in the sky. She moves to the Mistress of Novices study to wait. She wonders if Leane is alright, knowing how spiteful Elaida can be. She still feels sorrow at Alric. Egwene appears and they move to the novice dining hall. Siuan tells her about Delana and Halima. Egwene brings up Anaiya, murdered with saidin, and Siuan tells her it was somehow Halima. Siuan tells her about the envoy from the Dragon Reborn, how some Asha'man have bonded sisters, and his offer to let sisters bond Asha'man.</p>

    <p>The bonded sisters were sent by Elaida to destroy the Black Tower. And that saidin is cleansed. Egwene takes the shocks very well. Siuan tells her of Lelaine's and Romanda's tactics. Egwene is okay with that as well. They talk of the coming Last Battle. Elayne told Egwene of a room where One Power objects are stored. Siuan confirms it is a locked storeroom in the basement. Egwene says they will meet again in two days.</p>

    <h2>Ch 9, Leaving Malden, Wolf</h2>
    <p><strong>Perrin.</strong> Uh huh, Perrin can feel Rand pulling him, Rand needs him - that is his focus now. Perrin has over 100,000 refugees to take care of, Cairhienin and other gai'shain taken by the Shaido. Grady and Neald are too exhausted to make gateways.</p>

    <p>Aravine Carnel is supervising the refugees. She tells Perrin they are ready to leave. Perrin orders them to all march north. They will march until the Asha'man are recovered, then they will Travel to Cairhien or Andor.</p>

    <h2>Ch 10, The Last of the Tabac, Dragon</h2>
    <p><strong>Ituralde.</strong> Why yes please, I'd like to see more people meet Rand and describe him and then be sucked into his ta'veren pull. yes please! This was INCREDIBLE! Rand has no secured Ituralde - Ituralde will send some of his officers with Rand and Rand orders him to Saldaea!</p>

    <p>Its been nearly two weeks since Darluna - Ituralde carries a wrinkled notes with instructions from Alsalam, Ituralde is with Rajabi. The new SC general, who was unnamed here, has 300,000 men and two hundred damane. Ituralde and crew have retreated deep into AD only to learn there are 100,000 Aiel north of them. Ituralde+ are in an abandoned stedding, Ituralde thinks about Thom and how awesome he was and Ituralde is planning some spectular plan as his final fall. Rand shows up and Ituralde is struck with the ta'veren pull and agrees to help Rand.</p>

    <h2>Ch 11, The Death of Adrin, Pattern</h2>
    <p><strong>Aviendha.</strong> Whoa, book cover.. So Back at Lord Tallaen's log manor, the Maidens including Lerian and Surial are angry that Rand met with Ituralde alone. Aviendha is carrying rocks from the stream to the manor house and back, more punishment. She must regain her honor to merit Rand as much as Elayne and Min. Her time with Elayne made her more used to so much water. Bashere keeps a good camp, but the men move more slowly with the strange, dark sky.</p>

    <p>The next time she passes the door the guard Adrin looks very ill. Suddenly he rakes at his face and smoking black tarry coals pour out. He collapses, his clothing bursting into flame and setting the doorframe on fire. She weaves Air and Water to extinguish the fire but her weaves fail as they near the burning mass. She tries to smother the fire pulling up earth with Earth and Air but that is not enough. Finally, she weaves Air and Water to pull a spout of water from the stream. She sees other streams form; Naeff stands in a window above her. The water finally douses the fire. Rand comes out the door angrily shaking his fist at the sky and the Dark One.</p>

    <p>Merise says it is a shame that Aviendha is not in the White Tower with her talent. Melaine comes up and stares down Merise. Melaine then compliments Aviendha saying no Aes Sedai save perhaps Cadsuane could have done what she did. Melaine then asks her opinion on Rand's plan for the Council of Merchants. Rand's continued demands may alienate the clan chiefs. Rhuarc is wise and patient but others like Timolan are not. Melaine wonders what "remnant of a remnant" Rand will leave of the Aiel.</p>

    <p>Melaine then sends Aviendha to bed; she looks like a sharadan crawling for three days. There will be more punishment for tomorrow.Aviendha thinks about going to Rand, but she will not until she figures out how to restore her honor.</p>

    <h2>Ch 12, Unexpected Encounters, Darkfriend</h2>
    <p><strong>Egwene.</strong>  So there was a weird chapter break here, so it's been a MONTH since Egwene met with Siuan! Wow, this book has some actual time passing, that's great! Egwene is meeting with different Aes Sedai learning weaves and talking.. And then Egwene meets with the Salidar mole - Meidani who has an extra Oath from the BA Hunters and...</p>

    <p>Since only twelve Sitters were present at the vote that means Elaida was unlawfully raised as well. Egwene says they are all serving the Shadow as long as they remain divided. She orders them to make reuniting the Tower their prime mission and orders them to remove the fourth oath from the ferrets. The Sitters do not disagree and Egwene and Meidani leave. Meidani can barely believe that Egwene pulled it off. Egwene replies that they are wise enough to understand what needs to be done.</p>

    <p>Egwene practices some weaves, then none too subtly Bennae asks for advice on how to deal with her Sitters! She is in trouble for knowing about the thirteenth depository in the library, information from Egwene. Egwene mentally thanks Silviana for her advice on refusing to simply accept unjust punishment and gives Bennae excellent advice.</p>

    <p>Nagora works Egwene on logic problems that seem to relate to dealing with an aging, frustrated Warder! Then she gets a summons to Suana, her first meeting with a Sitter. Suana offers her a place in the Yellow Ajah even though Egwene is not strong in Healing! Egwene urges her to begin meeting with Sitters of the other Ajahs to help mend the White Tower.</p>

    <p>Egwene goes to her long overdue lesson with Meidani. Asked why she took so long, Meidani replies that she did not want to draw Elaida's suspicion. Egwene asks why Meidani does not flee the Tower but she will not answer. Egwene asks if she turned to Elaida before or after Beonin outed the ferrets and she furiously replies that she hates Elaida. She admits that they were pillow friends as novices. Egwene figures that Meidani is trapped by an oath and, instead of telling, asks her to show what is going on. She teaches Meidani the weave for Traveling and Meidani takes her to a basement corridor. She warns Egwene of the danger, wishing her Warder were not out of the city. Meidani takes her still deeper then knocks on a door.</p>

    <p>A Warder, Adsalan, opens it. Seaine, Yukiri, Saerin and Doesine are there. She asserts her authority enough that they divulge their purpose and plan to seek out the Black Ajah. Saerin states that Elaida is the lawfully raised Amyrlin. Egwene states that Siuan was unlawfully deposed, then asks if they found any Black Ajah among the Sitters who raised Elaida. Doesine admits that they did.</p>

    <p>Since only twelve Sitters were present at the vote that means Elaida was unlawfully raised as well. Egwene says they are all serving the Shadow as long as they remain divided. She orders them to make reuniting the Tower their prime mission and orders them to remove the fourth oath from the ferrets. The Sitters do not disagree and Egwene and Meidani leave. Meidani can barely believe that Egwene pulled it off. Egwene replies that they are wise enough to understand what needs to be done. She wishes there were more like them and Silviana in the Tower. They hurry to return before Egwene's Red Ajah escort becomes suspicious.</p>

    <p>Undulate/undulating count: 3</p>

    <h2>Ch 13, An Offer and a Departure, Heron-Marked Sword</h2>
    <p><strong>Gawyn.</strong> Oh yes, let's do this Gawyn! I knew he was going to try something like this.. Gawyn should have his own heron-marked sword, he killed Hammar (warder with a heron-marked sword).. He's good. His loyalty is with Andor and Elayne but his heart is with Egwene.</p>

    <p>Sleete (Warder - who beat Lan 2/7 bouts lol) says Hattori went with the embassy to Rand to get out of the Tower, not knowing the real goal. Gawyn thinks what a monster Rand is. Gawyn then goes to see Narenwin ... Katerine is there (she Traveled!) and tells them that Egwene is the Amyrlin and is now prisoner. Gawyn then packs a saddlebag to leave. Passing Rajar, he says he is going to inspect an outpost. As Gawyn saddles Challenge, Sleete appears. He knows Gawyn is leaving but will not stop him. Gawyn leaves Dorlan, riding for help to rescue Egwene.</p>

    <h2>Ch 14, A Box Opens, Ornaments</h2>
    <p><strong>Cadsuane.</strong> This is neat, I think lol. Cadsuane, Bair, and Sorilea (aiel came from Bandar Eban) are looking at Semirhage. Daigian and Sarene are holding her shield. Cadsuane is using weaves for sleep deprivation.</p>

    <p>Sorilea responds that Semirhage seems more human than she expected and this seems to annoy Semirhage. She responds that she would like to see how hard she has to push to make an Aiel kill a blacksmith. After the weaves are reset, Sorilea says they should kill her; she is too dangerous. Cadsuane agrees she is dangerous, but she has valuable knowledge of weaves and the other Forsaken. The Forsaken are not as twisted as Myrddraal or Draghkar. Oddly, according to Rand, the Forsaken are very human, being petty, destructive and argumentative.</p>

    <p>As they leave, Cadsuane instructs Daigian and Sarene to make sure she is kept awake. They go to Cadsuane's room. On the way, she thinks how far she still has to go to get Rand ready for the Last Battle. In her room, a battered document box contains special items. She has it warded with inverted weaves. Cadsuane disarms the box and opens it. It contains the access key and the original sad bracelets. Cadsuane left the a'dam, the sad bracelets copies and Callandor with some retired Aes Sedai. Cadsuane tested an a'dam on herself and could not escape. Sorilea says Rand has grown worse. Cadsuane agrees and they set to making a plan.</p>

    <h2>Ch 15, A Place to Begin, Dragon</h2>
    <p><strong>Rand.</strong> I AM A HAPPY MATT. Moridin is Ishamael. Ishamael is back in Rand's dreams. I am a happy Matt. Let's dive in. But first, I have a new prediction.... LTT is not real. LTT isn't going to be a seperate person that Rand interacts with, this is just going to be a voice in his head until the Last Battle, and then Rand won't hear LTT again. Now I'm a sad Matt.</p>

    <p>Rand wakes in TAR (he thinks - I think so too), and he is in a stone hallway, he opens a door to a simple room with arches looking on a sky with burning red clouds, there is a fireplace with two high chairs, the stones of the fireplace look burned. Moridin sits in one of the chairs. Rand recognizes him from his visions similar to Mat and Perrin and from Shadar Logoth!!! THAT WAS MORIDIN - I'M RIGHT AGAIN! The colors don't appear here in Tar.. Rand insists that Moridin is dead, he replies that Rand is dead too when he lashed out created Dragonmount... that was LTT sir. Rand wonders how many Forsaken have returned and Moridin mentions balfire. Rand notices LTT is gone from his mind and he feels more stable. Moridin then asks Rand why he came here. Moridin says he could kill Semirhage for what she did. Rand says he will defeat the DO - Moridin says it doesn't matter. The DO has all eternity and he only has to win once to stop the Wheel. Rand intends to kill the DO and Moridin replies that Rand can't comprehend how stupid that plan is. Rand reaches for the OP and is pulled back into normal sleep.</p>

    <p><strong>Min.</strong> THIS.IS.GOOD. Min is reading Pondering by Pelateos and thinks of Herid Fel. She thinks she has discovered a clue to reseal the DO. Rand wakes and says LTT is back. He admits to her that Semi was right about the voice and tells her the viewing of the two people merging into one proves LTT is real. He tells her Ishamael is back. He will use balefire to kill them permanently, despite what Cadsuane said. Min tells him that he must destroy the remaining seals. Rand says yes. More viewings - fireflies consumed in darkness, three women before a pyre, flashes of light, darkness, shadow, signs of dea, crowns, injuries, pain, and hope. Rand asks if she has found what to do with after breaking the seals. She promises to find answers. It's a place to begin.</p>

    <p><strong>Avi.</strong> I feel like the Aiel are going to pull a Peter Quill (spoilers for Avengers: Infinity War lol). I imagine we're all going to get to these SC negotiations and the Aiel are going to see the Shaido collared and RIP HOUSE and blow up this whole SC truce plan Rand is building. That will not be good.</p>

    <p>Aviendha is being punished still. Flinn, Bashere, Aiel, and Saldaeans return from their meeting with SC. Corana (maiden) tell Amys the SC have agreed to meeting Rand. Corana says the SC are showing off Shaido WOs damane. Amys will think up better punishments for Avi tomorrow.</p>

    <h2>Ch 16, In the White Tower, Flame</h2>
    <p><strong>Egwene.</strong> This is really good. I love the politicing. Egwene, you're freaking awesome, I see it now. Egwene standing up against Elaida as Elaida is literally beating her with the Power... freaking heck, Egwene is a beast! WOW WOW WOW!</p>

    <p>Egwene is with some Whites, Ferane, Miyasi, and Tesan asking her opinion on the Dragon Reborn. Egwene thinks logic is good but emovtion is needed. Egwene answers that she would send a delegation of Gray, Blue, and Green. Gray for negotiation, Blue because he favors them from Moiriane (aw), and Green because they're perceived opposite of Reds.</p>

    <p>Katerine gives her the forkroot. Then says Egweene will be choring instead of learning. Then Laras tries to sneak her out.. why does she have a way to sneak people out of the Tower? Egwene meets with Elaida who has Ferane, Yukiri, Doesine, Rubinde, and Shevan (no Red present). Egwene outsmarts Elaida with her competence and the Sitters all nod or smile at Egwene. Egwene quotes Balladare Arandaille (the first Brown Amyrlin) after the Kavarthen Wars, "The Amyrlin is the servant of all, even the lowest of laborers." Egwene calls her a coward and Elaids snaps, calling Egwene a Darkfriend!</p>

    <p>As Elaida beats her with Air, Egwene falls to the floor on the shards of the broken pitcher she was holding, cutting herself severely. Elaida orders her to the dungeons as she passes out.</p>

    <h2>Ch 17, Questions of Control, Puzzle</h2>
    <p><strong>Cadsuane.</strong> Well, quite interesting method that we've never seen before in the Wheel of Time... spanking. lol. So, Cadsuane spanks Semirhage lol.</p>

    <p><strong>Perrin.</strong> Perrin and crew are working on going North, where Rand is pulling him. Perrin is ready to go back to the Wolf Dream to look for answers.. YES! See, now I love the Wolf Dream, I want to know more!</p>

    <h2>Ch 18, A Message in Haste, Fish</h2>
    <p><strong>Siuan.</strong> Oh oh, this book has spanned a few months already! That's great news! Now, apparently Elaida has Travelling down... whoa! That is big. Sharina is also awesome. Siuan has a message sent to Bryne to have their flanks watched.</p>

    <p>Sharina is helping Siuan as she knows Lelaine or Romanda would end the practice of older novices were they in control. Siuan says she will make sure Egwene knows of her loyalty.</p>

    <h2>Ch 19, Gambits, Seanchan</h2>
    <p><strong>Tuon.</strong> Oh yes, I like this. I like this a lot. Tuon is great.. relatively lol. But I appreciate the pomp and the bowing and prostrating and such for Tuon lol. SO! The SC attack on the WT might be happening! Is this battle going to be massive, please yes! Beslan is now High Blood, cool. Tylee comes in with Trolloc heads.. yse! This is good stuff, y'all.</p>

    <p>Tuon orders Galgan to setup a meeting with the DR, she wishes that Mat were with her. love it.</p>

    <h2>Ch 20, On a Broken Road, Dice</h2>
    <p><strong>Mat.</strong> So Mat misses Tuon, sweet. Matt and the Band + Joline, Edesina, Teslyn + crew are riding along an anciet road northeast of the Damona Mountains.</p>

    <p>Olver and Noal ride up. Olver has been working out how to sneak into the Tower of Ghenjei. Vanin returns with news that the village of Hinderstap is just ahead. Joline, Edesina and Teslyn ride up. They want to know how far they are from Caemlyn. Vanin says two hundred leagues, a little over a week for someone with spare horses, twenty days for the whole Band. Joline and Edesina want to go off on their own to get there faster. They demand horses for the two sul'dam, Setalle and probably Teslyn.</p>

    <p>Olver and Noal ride up. Olver has been working out how to sneak into the Tower of Ghenjei. Vanin returns with news that the village of Hinderstap is just ahead. Mat sends them off in a huff, then sends Vanin to tell Mandevwin to prepare to make camp. A few of them will go to the village for supplies. Talmanes says the Two Rivers tabac, a gift from King Roedran, is gone. Mat plans to gamble for the supplies. Egwene or Nynaeve would box his ears at the idea but Talmanes is enthusiastic.</p>
    
    <h2>Ch 21, Embers and Ash, Wolf</h2>
    <p>Perrin. I'm with Perrin here. Hopper, please help. Perrin is in the Wolf Dream, the sky is stomry with unusal violent clouds. Hoppers says the Last Hunt is coming. Perrin tries to tell Hopper about losing control but the wolf doesn't understand. Hopper wants to run, but Perrin insists on Hopper teaching him, then Perrin is kicked out of the dream.</p>

    <p><strong>Faile.</strong> Important bits for me.. Gaul killed the Aiel that made Bain and Chiad gai'shain which makes B and C gai'shain to Gaul, and Bain wants to lay the bridal wreath at Gaul's feet. Then Faile, Arrela, Lacile, and Alliandre burn momentos for the memory of those who helped them.</p>

    <p><strong>Perrin.</strong> And Perrin decides to face his problems and goes back to sleep. </p>

    <h2>Ch 22, The Last That Could Be Done, Forsnaken</h2>
    <p><strong>Semirhage.</strong> Oh no, oh no, oh no! Shaidar Haran tells Semirhage she's been given one last chance and her block was broken. There are three dead bodies outside her cell, and one lone Aes Sedai, which I'm guessing in Elza since she is Black but we'll see. Cadsuane also wears, what Semirhage calls, a paralis-net in her hair. Elza (my guess) says she was told to tell Semi that she is to remove the Compusion on her and gives her the Domination Band (male a'dam). OH NO.</p>

    <p><strong>Rand.</strong> Rand has used.. the True Power. Oh my goodness. Rand has used the True Power and balefired Semirhage, also Elza too. Holy smokes. Okay, let's talk. </p>

    <p>Rand is back at the manor and Semirhage clasps the Domination Band on Rand. Min throws a quick knife at Semi (nice Min). At no point this chapter did I think we were losing Min. Truly. Elza enters and takes the other bracelet. Semi tortures Rand, but the pain hardly affects him after the box. Semi then forces Rand to torture Min with saidin. Rand then begins to strangle Min. Then, something snaps inside Rand and all emotion goes away and he can sense a *new force*. Rand takes hold of it and LTT screams "it's HIM". The collar explosed and Semi realizes it's the True Power and the DO betrayed her. Rand uses balefire to destroy her and Elza. Min recovers, and they now took everything away from him - that was the last that could be done. WHOA! THE IMPLICATIONS!</p>

    <p>Rand is with Bashere and Ituralde, 50 soldiers, 50 maidens, and Narishma - they're at the Blight. Rand tasks Ituralde with protecting the Blight. ...</p>

    <p>The Blight is slowly advancing. Rand orders Narishma to open a gateway then tells Ituralde to send reports via Asha'man to Bandar Eban. He will move his headquarters there in four days. Rand thinks he can trust Narishma one of the men from Dumai's Wells. Lews Therin does not. Rand thinks back on his dream of Moridin with no Lews Therin in his head. He wonders why Moridin saved him at Shadar Logoth when fighting Sammael. He thinks that he must be hard, yet Min does not want that. "To live you must die." How can one laugh and face that?</p>

    <p>Lews Therin tells him that Min is right. He must break the seals. Lews Therin says they touched the Dark One with saidin and that is how he tainted it. Deira Bashere is waiting for her husband. Rand thinks of Tam as his father even though he knows Janduin was his real father. A small voice in his mind asks if he cares about his legacy. He founded schools in Cairhien and Andor because he wanted to leave something. Now he thinks he cannot fix everything. The voice asks if the goal is to survive or to thrive?</p>

    <h2>Ch 23, A Warp in the Air, Dragon</h2>
    <p><strong>Cadsuane.</strong> Well here we go now. Rand will not be laughing anymore. Wow. What is this air warping around him?? I am interesting in seeing what happens now. Somehow Shaidar Haran didn't alert their Warder. Also, RIP Daigian.. </p>

    <p>Nynaeve watches Rand. Cadsuane is shocked by Rand; he is utterly unemotional, but there is a darkness about him. He shows Narishma how to make balefire. Cadsuane is angry, but Rand says it is needed to permanently kill Forsaken. Semirhage is dead. Cadsuane is further shocked to see the sad bracelets on the bed. Rand has her box, opened despite her wards. The access key is also gone. Rand exiles Cadsuane on pain of death. The air seems to warp and the room appears darker. Rand says that he can kill her simply by willing it and she believes him. Rand tells everyone in the room to prepare to leave.</p>

    <h2>Ch 24, A New Commitment, Bull</h2>
    <p><strong>Gawyn.</strong> Ah Gawyn the First Prince of the Sword. I thought this would turn out differently for him.</p>

    <p>So.. Bryne takes him to his tent and gives him a tongue-lashing for his behavior. He chides Gawyn for not being with Elayne in Caemlyn. Only slightly cowed, Gawyn insists that they must rescue Egwene. He casually mentions that he saw an Aes Sedai in the camp and Bryne is surprised. Concerned that she might be a White Tower spy, they go to look for her. Gawyn questions why Bryne left Caemlyn. He refuses to listen to Bryne's explanation of Morgase and Gaebril. He still believes Rand is a monster despite what anyone tells him. They find the Aes Sedai; she is Shemerin. She has been masquerading as "Lady Tagren". They take her to the Aes Sedai camp.</p>

    <h2>Ch 25, In Darkness, Darkfriend</h2>
    <p><strong>Sheriam.</strong> I am shocked. SHOCKED! Sheriam.. is Black?! how is that even? who woul've guessed, besides Leon of course lol. Hard to believe, I'm sure the signs were there! Also, this has to have been Masaana, right? And Sheriam is definiltey loosing some appendages.</p>

    <p>Sheriam joined her "friends" solely for power; she has no interest in the Last Battle or the Chosen. Suddenly, she senses a woman of great strength outside her tent. A black figure enters and Sheriam makes obeisance. The figure says that Egwene must be deposed and the Tel'aran'rhiod meetings must end. Sheriam explains that the Hall has dream ter'angreal. She truthfully says that there are twenty, eighteen for the Hall, one for her, and one other that Leane had when she was captured. The figure orders Sheriam to steal all of them. She has three days, and will lose a finger or toe for each one she misses. The figure opens a gateway to the halls of the White Tower and vanishes.</p>

    <p><strong>Egwene.</strong> Elaida is going to try Egwene as a Darkfriend. The DO is still causing evil changes. Seaine confirms that Elaida will be tried for breaking Tower law, but nothing she did is severe enough for her to be removed from the Amyrlin.</p>

    <h2>Ch 26, A Crack in the Stone, Pattern</h2>
    <p><strong>Aviendha.</strong> Oh heck, Aviendha bringing me to tears here. Oh I love this so much. This makes me so happy. SO! Aviendha was doing chores for her to realize she was ACTUALLY READY to be a Wise One... whoa! heavy lol. Min is worried about Rand, as is Avi. Will we see Avi go through the columns? I hope so!</p>

    <p>She storms through the camp until she finds Amys, Bair and Melaine. She says she refuses to take orders from them any more if they have nothing left to teach her. Bair and Melaine laugh! Aviendha has finally passed the last test, demanding to be accepted as an equal! The declaration makes one a Wise One. This is the reason Sevanna was accepted by the others.</p>

    <p>Aviendha will now Travel to Cold Rocks Hold then run to Rhuidean where she will traverse the glass columns. As she walks through the gateway to the Aiel Waste she exults. Her honor has returned.</p>

    <p><strong>Romanda.</strong> The crew is questioning Shemerin.. come on RJ (Shemerin in the same room with Sheriam.. lol). Anyway, Siuan, Romanda, Lelaine, Sheriam, and Magla are questioning her. Apparenlty Shemerin answers all questions and tells them about this Watergae she used to escape the city by the statue of Eleyan al'Landerin and her Warder - have those names we've heard before? Anyway, Romanda is in favor of Egwene and keeping her Amyrlin. Also, roaches attack and they burn down the tent. Magla says the roaches are a kind only seen in Shara.</p>

    <h2>Ch 27, The Tipsy Gelding, Dice</h2>
    <p>Mat. That was fun! Right? lol.</p>

    <p>Mat rides Pips into Hinderstap, a little smaller than Baerlon, accompanied by Joline, Edesina, Teslyn, Blaeric, Fen, Talmanes, Thom, Harnan, Delarn and three other soldiers. Aludra, Egeanin, Amathera, Noal and Olver stayed behind. He refuses to think about Tuon. Thom is reading his letter from Moiraine again. Bayle Domon will lead them to the Tower of Ghenjei in a few weeks. He wonders if they will run into Lanfear. They are heading to Caemlyn, but may stop at Four Kings on the way. Mat thinks of Rand and sees an image of him slumped in a chair missing a hand. Thom quotes a poem on the Wheel of Time written by Doreille Torghin, a queen of Aridhol (City). She visited this area called the Splintered Hills near the Eagle's Reaches in Coremanda.</p>

    <p>Mat and Talmanes go into an average inn, The Tipsy Gelding. Mat loses a bunch (on purpose), Harnan and Delarn bring in a chest of gold and Mat bets against a wagon of provisions for the Band. It is getting dark and Mat makes the decision to stay and the dice stop. The wagon is loaded and Mat wins the toss and when Mat goes into the street, there is no one in the street and they hear screaming.</p>

    <h2>Ch 28, Night in Hinderstap, Pattern</h2>
    <p><strong>Mat.</strong> So the screaming was the entire town going crazy. But what the heck? They're all back to normal in the morning?? What is going on?! Well that was terribly sad.</p>

    <p>Mat asks him about the picture. Barlden told Ledron that they will not sell out visitors. The picture, and another of a man with golden eyes, came from an inn called The Shaken Fist in the village of Trustair. Mat rides Pips and leads the wagon horse with their food and gold as they leave Hinderstap. Thom thinks it is sad. There is something wrong in the world. The Pattern is unraveling.</p>

    <p>Mat pulls Pips away from The Tipsy Gelding and he, Talmanes, Harnan and Delarn try to flee, leaving the wagon and gold behind. Delarn is dragged from his horse and badly wounded but Mat saves him. Thom joins them and they ride to the inn where the Aes Sedai are. On the first floor, the cook is the only one left alive and Mat kills him when he attacks. Master Tobrad, the innkeeper, is dead, too. They make it up the stairs and find Joline, Edesina, Teslyn, Blaeric and Fen and the three Redarms. Two bound serving girls struggle to get loose. Downstairs, Edesina Heals Delarn. They all ride out of town, taking the serving girls with them, and camp on a nearby hillside to wait for dawn.</p>

    <p>Hours later, Mat is moping that the Dark One is still chasing him. The gholam is still somewhere out there. Myrddraal and Darkfriends, too. Thom shows Mat a picture he got at another inn, an image of Mat. Someone is looking for him, a woman in a village north of here.</p>

    <p>Suddenly, the two bound serving girls just vanish. Mat and Thom ride back toward Hinderstap to investigate. At the fine inn, Mat recognizes the cook that he killed! He thinks they are ghosts until they reach a spot of intense fighting the night before and see no blood on the ground. Barlden comes up and offers to explain. This has been going on for several months, since just before the Feast of Abram. Everyone goes crazy at dusk, killing everyone they can. In the morning, they all wake in their own beds. Barlden dreamed of killing old man Garken only to find him alive the next day. Sammrie the cooper had relatives come to visit. They were murdered that night and then became permanent residents.</p> 

    <p>Mat asks him about the picture. Barlden told Ledron that they will not sell out visitors. The picture, and another of a man with golden eyes, came from an inn called The Shaken Fist in the village of Trustair. Mat rides Pips and leads the wagon horse with their food and gold as they leave Hinderstap. Thom thinks it is sad. There is something wrong in the world. The Pattern is unraveling.</p>

    <h2>Ch 29, Into Bandar Eban, Dragon</h2>
    <p><strong>Rand.</strong> MAP! I am in complete agreement with Rand and Forsaken = balefire deaths. 100%. Also, I am looking forward to more of this new Rand. Fierce. Also, King Alsalam.. I presume DEAD!</p>

    <p>Rand and crew are in Bandar Eban. Rand thinks about his list of women starting Moiraine, and he wonders about Lanfear - if she's back like Ishi... yes she is! Rand sends Dobraine to Tear. I trust Dobraine, I do, I think. Rand then meets with Milisair, one of the merchant council, and asks her about King Alsalam. She is extremely nervous when he demands that she produce the last messenger from the king. Rand then orders runners to bring scribes, stewards, Rhuarc and Bael to begin planning grain distribution. He plans to kill Graendal with balefire like Semirhage.</p>

    <p>Rand rides into a square to meet Dobraine who presents him with the restored city. He tells Rand that he has one of the merchant council, Milisair Chadmar. Rand wonders if he trusts Dobraine. He knows Rand intends the Sun Throne for Elayne. Rand adds Semirhage and Elza to his list even though they do not deserve it. He has the access key with him, found in Cadsuane's apartment. There are only a few Sea Folk rakers in the port.</p>

    <h2>Ch 30, Old Advice, Heron-Marked Sword</h2>
    <p><strong>Gawyn.</strong> Gawyn is meeting with the Aes Sedai and Lelaine is asking about Elayne's policy on taxing House Traemane, Gawyn doesn't know why. Gawyn then talks with Bryne, and they discuss allegiances.</p>

    <p>They discuss the Younglings and Gawyn refuses to betray them. Gawyn still thinks Rand is a monster who must be killed. Bryne asks Gawyn if he understands his true allegiances. Whom does he serve? Bryne was not sure himself when he was a captain in the Aiel War, but Laman got what he deserved. He then served Morgase but she failed him. He now serves the rebels because it is the right thing to do. Gawyn feels that something bad is coming, but he does not understand the different sides and does not know what to do.</p>

    <h2>Ch 31, A Promise to Lews Therin, Ornaments</h2>
    <p>Cadsuane. Cadsuane has a new plan, I'm assuming for Rand, but she tells the WOs, after meeting at The Wind's Favor with an inkeeper that has been a good source of info for her all these years..</p>

    <p>Quillin Tasil - He is Andoran but his wife is a retired, wealthy Domani merchant. His daughter Namine is Brown Ajah and works in the Tower library. She asks him about Alsalam and Quillin says no one has really seen him in half a year. There are 24,000 Aiel in the city. Rand's ta'veren effect is now all negative with no positive balance. After she leaves the inn she plans what to do next. She realizes she mishandled Rand. The Domination Bracelet were not her fault. The Seanchan had made others, so that one was taken specifically to sow mistrust.</p>

    <p>As she approaches the docks, she turns to see Rand and his entourage approaching her. She seems to accidentally run into him quite often. She still sees darkness around him from the corner of her eye and it terrifies her. She has failed trying to guide him. He trusts no one but Min. She returns to the mansion; Aiel now camp where Dobraine had his men. She goes to the Wise Ones' area and finds Sorilea, Amys and the others. She admits she has failed and they say she has no toh. She says she has a plan and they want to hear it.</p>

    <p><strong>Rand.</strong> Yikes. I was up for this conversation between Rand and Nynaeve until Rand basically said "I hope Lan dies, that will distract the Shadow enough for me to with the Last Battle".. YIKES. I'm interested in this Falme conversation between Rand and Tuon. Also, Rand saw Cadsuane lol. Who is going to be King of Arad Doman if Alsalam is dead? I don't know. Also, Perrin is with Galad? That sounds like a fun meeting.</p>

    <p>About Lan and Arad Doman..</p>

    <p>Rand asks Nynaeve if Lan is riding to Malkier and she admits that he is. He will reach Tarwin's Gap in two or three months. Rand says that if he attacks with only a small force he deserves what he will get. Nynaeve is shocked and angry.</p>

    <p>When they return to the mansion he meets with Rhuarc. Rand still has not decided what to do about Alsalam. Rhuarc reports that they found another of the Council of Merchants, Alamindra Cutren. Meashan Dubaris is dead. That makes four captured and two dead. They need four more for a legal vote for a new king. Milisair Chadmar stands to the side looking disheveled. Rand dismisses Rhuarc then summons her. She reluctantly reports that the messenger from Alsalam is dead. Jalani reports that they caught her trying to flee. Lord Piqor Ramshalan who hates her suggests she should be executed. Rand orders her locked in her own dungeon where she held the messenger. Rand asks if any others of the Merchant Council have heard from the king and a clerk named Noreladim reports that they have not. Lews Therin points out that if Graendal sent the messenger then Rand would never have been able to break his Compulsion.</p>

    <h2>Ch 32, Rivers of Shadow, Wheel and Snake</h2>
    <p><strong>Nynaeve.</strong> Alright, more ghosts. Nynaeve doing some Healing. Nynaeve goes to show Rand she can be useful. </p>

    <p>As she enters the mansion grounds, Haster Nalmat, the Saldaean officer on duty, bows to her. Inside the gates, she commandeers three soldiers. In the mansion, she sends servants for the dosun, the head housekeeper. Loral soon arrives. Nynaeve asks her where the messenger was imprisoned and questioned. She and four of the servants lead Nynaeve and the soldiers to The Gull's Feast, an area near the docks where fishermen dump waste.</p>

    <p>They reach a chandler's shop. Nynaeve leaves one of the soldiers to stay with the servants and dosun while the other two, Triben and Lurts, accompany her. They break into the shop and find two guards and the questioner upstairs. Back downstairs there is a young Domani man, the apprentice. They enter the basement through a trapdoor and find the dungeon. Milisair Chadmar is in a cell. Nynaeve questions them about the messenger but Jorgin, the questioner, insists that he just died. One of the thugs is named Mord. Jorgin convinces her he is telling the truth. Before she leaves, she checks on Milisair and finds that she was poisoned with tarchrot leaf. Jorgin says the apprentice, Kerb, prepared the food. Hurrying back upstairs, they find the front door open, but the four servants grabbed Kerb as he tried to run away.</p>

    <h2>Ch 33, A Conversation with the Dragon, Dragon</h2>
    <p><strong>Nynaeve.</strong> I am in agreement with Rand. As Lan says "duty is heavier than a mountain". Rand has to see this completed. He has to see the Last Battle won. There are sacrifices they all have to make and Rand is right. He can't stop for every death in his way. There might be some that can be stopped, and maybe this could've been it, but Nynaeve was exhausted. I don't know. But Rand has to see this through. Whatever the costs.</p>

    <p>SO, Kerb had Compulsion from Graendal, Nynaeve wove the exact weave and that removed it. Kerb whispers "Natrin's Barrow" then dies. Rand then tells Nynaeve a story about Tam and parts of how Tam found Rand on Dragonmount. </p>

    <p>Nynaeve is angry that he could not be Healed. Rand is heartless. She tells Rand that his anger will destroy him and he agrees, shocking her. He tells her a story from Tam, that no one has ever climbed Dragonmount because, after reaching the top, they would be too exhausted to climb down and so die up there. Rand only has to reach the Last Battle. He will die then so there does not need to be anything left of him to salvage. He can accept Nynaeve because she truly cares about him, unlike Cadsuane. Min has fallen asleep so he carries her back to his rooms. He tells Nynaeve that he will deal with the Seanchan first, then Graendal.</p>

    <h2>Ch 34, Legends, Dice</h2>
    <p><strong>Mat.</strong> I tell you what, I have always liked Verin. She truly feels like a sweet grandmother lol. I love Mat's remark "you've got Traveling don't you?". YES! This is awesome!</p>

    <p>So, Mat and crew are going to approach Trustair to find out who was looking for him. They go to an inn The Shaken Fist where the pictures came from, there is an absolutely ELABORATE STORY that Mat devised. Also, the memories the Eelfin gave him are very nicely blended with his own lol. </p>

    <p>Aludra has a HUGE list of requirements for her Dragons. Mat is feeling the pull northward to Rand. Aludra needs all the copper and tin and every bellfounder in the lands that Rand controls. </p>

    <p>Olver comes up and Verin is here, she was looking for Mat. She says she can have Mat and the Band to Caemlyn by evening saving him 20 days. She wants free of his ta'veren web - she has a story to tell! </p>

    <h2>Ch 35, A Halo of Blackness, Seanchan</h2>
    <p><strong>Rand.</strong> Oh I'm happy to be back at Falme. Rand remembers Falme when he followed Fain, the Horn, and the ruby dagger. Falme was where he first acknowledged who he is. He wears a sword that reminds him of Falme, and talks about killing Turak. Nynaeve, 3 WOs, Corele, Narishma, and Flinn are here. Rand has the access key, just in case. Rand seized saidin, the other day Rand woke crying for Ilyena, his eyesight is slowly getting better. They approach a pavilion and Tuon is there!  </p>

    <p><strong>Tuon.</strong> way of kings... brando. OH SHOOT! We are about to have a BATTLE ON OUR HANDS Y'ALL! WOOOOOOOOO! Tuon says "I am the Empress". SHEEEEEESH! SO GOOD! Okie dokie, let's break this down, maybe.</p>

    <p>Rand enters and Tuon is acessing all. Rand demands peace, in Tuon's mind, the Last Battle will be between the Empire and the Shadow with the Dragon Reborn as a tool against Lighteater. She is surprised that he is not blinded yet... WHAT?! Rand is supposed to go blind?! According to SC Prophecy I guess. Anyway, they talk about Mat, Nynaeve backs Mat up. Rand leans forward and a ta'veren pull occurs - a dark halo surrounds Rand (I AM VERY INTERESTED IN THIS). Tuon REFUSES. Rand and crew leaves. Tuon says she is Empress and tells Glagan and Yulan to PREPARE TO STRIKE AGAINST THE WHITE TOWER IMMEDIATELY. SHOOOOOOOOOT!</p>

    <h2>Ch 36, The Death of Tuon, Wheel</h2>
    <p><strong>Mat.</strong> Ta'veren is one of the coolest things that Robert Jordan has come up with. This is so simple, yet so awesome. AWESOME. I'm super interested in this letter that Verin gave Mat - I appreciate that she had more than one letter, and she chose just the right letter (ta'veren). SO COOL!</p>

    <p>Verin tells Mat, Talmanes and Mandevwin her story. She was with Rand in Tear. She tells him that Rand cleansed the taint on saidin. She left Tear to go to Tar Valon, but something always prevented her from staying in one spot long enough to learn it for Traveling. She and Tomas finally caught a ride with a merchant going to Cairhien, but fell asleep. They woke to find he had changed directions, going to Murandy now. Finally, she tries Skimming, but Tomas mentions a trip to Trustair at the exact moment and that is where they wind up. Verin gives up knowing the Pattern is forcing her to either Mat or Perrin. She uses the pictures that were given to her by a Darkfriend who wants them dead. She warns him to be very careful. She offers Mat a bargain. She will take him and the Band to Caemlyn if he will promise to follow the instructions in a sealed letter. He sees that she has several similar sealed letters in her pouch. He refuses. She then offers him a different deal. He must stay in Caemlyn for fifty days. They compromise on thirty and she gives him the sealed letter in case he changes his mind. He wonders if Elayne is there and if she will help him get started on Aludra's dragons. He will also need time to learn all he can about the Tower of Ghenjei. He does not think Thom will complain about the time. Verin takes out a flower brooch and they begin to break camp.</p>

    <p><strong>Tuon.</strong> The Seanchan have incredible names. Tuon is now Fortuona, the Empress. </p>

    <p>It is a few days since the meeting with the Dragon Reborn. Tuon takes a new name, Fortuona. She gives her blessing to the five Bloodknives who will go on the Tar Valon raid. Bloodknives wear ter'angreal rings activated by their own blood. The rings give them extra stamina and speed, but also kill them in a few days. Fortuona personally donated a damane and sul'dam, Dali and Malahavana, to the raid. Hundreds of raken and to'raken prepare for flight. It is early evening. Lieutenant-General Yulan will personally lead the raid. Traveling only at night for secrecy, the flight to Tar Valon will take several days. Fortuona tells Selucia that General Galgan is wrong. This will not weaken the Dragon Reborn. It will turn him against them. Selucia asks if that was not already the case and Fortuona replies, "No. We were against him." They will see how big a difference that is.</p>

    <h2>Ch 37, A Force of Light, Dragon</h2>
    <p><strong>Min.</strong> GOOD GRACIOUS. I am still on Rand's side here. He's right. He had to completely balefire he entire palace out of existence. WHOA. Also, Min's viewing.. Dragonmount cloaked in dark shadows, as if shaded by clouds high above, with a tiny prick of light shining from the heavens down onto the point of the mountain... hmmmmm. Also, Nynaeve has been tasked with finding Perrin... interesting plans Cadsuane....</p>

    <p>In a couple of hours he returns, reporting that the owner is pleasant and wishes to cooperate. At Rand's command, Nynaeve Delves him and learns that he is, indeed, under Compulsion. Min tells him he should ask for advice before acting rashly, perhaps Cadsuane. Rand says Cadsuane held him in a box. Callandor is another box, requiring a circle to be used safely. He was angry when he used Callandor. He must be unemotional. He must kill with a purpose as when he killed Liah at Shadar Logoth. The access key glows and he balefires all of Natrin's Barrow. Nynaeve and Min are horrified that he callously murdered dozens of people but Rand calls it a mercy. Nynaeve Delves Ramshalan again. The Compulsion is gone proving Graendal is dead.</p>

    <p>Rand turns to Ramshalan. He knows of his bragging to Lords Vivian and Callswell and exiles him. The others return to the mansion in Bandar Eban. Nynaeve wishes Moiraine were there. She thinks Cadsuane is right; no one person can handle Rand. Nynaeve and Min head for the cottage where Cadsuane is staying. They pass Alivia on the way. Merise, Cadsuane, Amys, Bair, Melaine and Sorilea are there. Nynaeve relates what happened and says she wants to be part of their plan. Cadsuane will give her a chance if she can be obedient. She thinks Nynaeve may be salvageable and Amys adds that Egwene also has great honor. Cadsuane gives Nynaeve an assignment, to find Perrin Aybara. Rand may know where he is. Min thinks her job is to get Rand to the Last Battle alive and sane with his soul intact.</p>

<h2>Ch 38, News in TAR, TAR</h2>
<p><strong>Egwene.</strong> Couple Q’s, who is the new Mistress of Novices? How has Verin relinquished her Oaths? What does that mean for Mat?!</p>

<p>In a meeting in Tel'aran'rhiod, Siuan tries to convince Egwene that Elaida will never let her go. They are meeting every night now. This time they are meeting in Naorman Mashinta's cobbler shop in Tar Valon. They debate whether Elaida could have her executed. After Egwene ends the discussion, Siuan tells her that Gawyn is in the camp. He keeps meeting with Lelaine and Romanda. Their meeting last night was cut short by another bubble of evil where tents came alive and strangled three people. Egwene's cell is tiny. She thinks Rand must have felt even worse when Elaida had him in the box. Siuan thinks Egwene may be the best Amyrlin since Artur Hawkwing's reign.</p>

<p>She wakes to renewed pain. She is still wearing the same bloody dress. The Red sisters who guard her cell now administer her beatings instead of Silviana. At noon, her guards, Barasine and another Red she does not know, bring her out of her cell for a beating. Katerine arrives with news that Egwene is to be freed and returned to the novice quarters. Katerine is the new Mistress of Novices. On their way, they run into Saerin. Saerin tells Egwene that Silviana confronted Elaida and the Hall demanding Egwene's release. Elaida ordered her imprisoned. The two Reds look concerned. Egwene tells them they should go check on what is happening to their Ajah. She asks a passing novice, Marsial, to bring forkroot so the Reds can leave. Barasine and Egwene proceed to her room and Marsial returns with the forkroot. Egwene downs it then Barasine hurries away. Egwene enters her room and finds Verin waiting for her! Egwene begins changing into a clean dress to get to work but Verin shocks her by lying about the color! She tells Egwene to sit down as they have a lot to talk about.</p>


<h2>Ch 39, A Visit from Verin Sedai, Darkfriend</h2>
<p><strong>Egwene.</strong> Oh Verin! What a freaking story we have on our hands. BLACKS EVERYWHERE. VERIN IS INCREDIBLE! Oh wow, she is something special. So many blacks to name. Also, THE SEANCHAN ARE ATTACKING THE TOWER! Gotta go!</p>

<h2>Ch 40, The Tower Shakes, Seanchan</h2>
<p><strong>Siuan.</strong> Oh yes, a duo I never thought of… Gawyn and Siuan going after Egwene to save her lol! Reading on!</p>

<p><strong>Egwene.</strong> Egwene has found some novices and they’re learning Linking to stop the SC. Egwene gateways to find a sa’angreal and stop the SC!! Woo!</p>

<p><strong>Siuan.</strong> Yay Siuan has bonded Bryne as Warder! And he is going to help! This seems like it could work!</p>

<p><strong>Adelorna.</strong> Oh dang, EGWENE IS A BEAST! I love the way it was written from someone else’s perspective to see Egwene and crew come bursting through and saving them all.</p>

<p>So Elaida has been showing off Traveling, and certainly the SC have it now.. OH NO! </p>

<h2>Ch 41, A Fount of Power, Bull</h2>
<p><strong>Gawyn.</strong> Oh yes, I like this! Gawyn, Siuan, Bryne and 100 of his soldiers arrive through a water channel into Tar Valon. The soldiers are dressed as Tower Guards, smart. I love the writing here.. they entered into a nightmare.. they plan to look for Egwene in the basement where the cells are.</p>

<p><strong>Saerin.</strong> Oh oh, Katerine is the is the new Mistress of Novices! Neat.. I guess lol. Also, freaking GO Egwene - the booms are coming from INSIDE THE TOWER... the NOVICE QUATERS! Also, Saerin (Brown), I like you. I like you a lot.</p>

<p><strong>Egwene.</strong> That's very interesting.. the SC don't like, they can't because the a'dams. Oh, interesting. Also, Egwene is the Fount of Power. Wow. I have always liked Egwene, but when she became Amrylin I was like whoa... who is this absolutely impressive person that has been in our midst the whole time. And this book, dang, she up at the top of my list for favorites.</p>

<p><strong>Gareth.</strong> DANG. Love this for Bryne and Siuan. ALso, these Bloodknives are WICKED! </p>

<p><strong>Egwene.</strong> Oh this is interesting, Egwene is too tired to stop Gawyn, Siuan, and Bryne from taking her away. She has planned on rebuilding the Tower!! </p>

<p><strong>Saerin.</strong> Oh yes, oh yes... Elaida has been taken by the Seanchan!!! Wait, should I be happy? I DON'T CARE YES! Well, we'll see how this plays out.</p>

<p><strong>Elaida.</strong> Elaida.. Suffa will be a good damane. How do you all feel about this? Are you happy? I think this is bad for Elaida, but I'm interested to see what happens.</p>

<p><em>Also, undulating count: 5 lol.</em> </p>
<p>Will the White Tower ever be rebuilt? Before the Last Battle... I think yes. Or at least, after the Last Battle we might get a "Egwene is overseeing the rebuilding of the White Tower" and your typical sitcom music lol. Maybe!</p>

<h2>Ch 42, Before the Stone of Tear, Dragon</h2>
<p><strong>Rand.</strong> Whoa, "where will we be marching?".. "to Shayol Ghul" YES! Rand and crew arrive in Tear after literally just up and leaving Arad Doman. Rand thinks he has failed Arad Doman - Milisair Chadmar (Council of Merchants) and the other four were returned to their palaces. Bashere says Ituralde has had skirmishes with Shadowspan, the SS are massing in the Blight, so they are probably in Tarwin's Gap as well. Rand thinks he must deal with the Borderlands next. Once Rand and crew get to the city square, Flinn and Naeff open gateways, a dockmaster Iralin tells Rand that ALL OF THE FOOD SPOILED. Bandar Eban will starve. Rand can do nothing more and leaves ot Feaster's Run in Tear.</p>

<h2>Ch 43, Sealed to the Flame, Flame of TV</h2>
<p><strong>Egwene.</strong> Well, they shouldn't have rescued her. I'll say it. Gawyn wants to be bonded, I get it. Not right now dude lol. Egwene has called a Hall of the Sitters, let's do this!</p>

<p><strong>Jesse.</strong> Hey, aren't some of these Black Ajah? lol Anyways:</p>

<p>Ajah heads Jesse Bilal (Brown), Adelorna (Green), Suana Dragand (Yellow), Ferane Neheran (White) and Serancha Colvine (Gray) meet to discuss what to do about leadership of the White Tower. Tsutama (Red) is too new to her position to be part of the meeting. The five of them have secretly been working together to try to manage Elaida.</p>

<p>Adelorna finally suggests Egwene and the others agree. They will choose an Amyrlin of strength. WOOOOO EGWENE! </p>

<p><strong>Siuan.</strong> I love this. I am a BIG fan of Siuan and Bryne. Glad he wants to marry her. I have no idea what Egwene is going to do to Siuan though...</p>

<p><strong>Egwene.</strong> Yay, Egwene has taken the Three Oaths! Also Sheriam has certainly lost an apendage or two lol. There are only 12 Sitters as each Ajah sent to the Black Tower.</p>

<p>She then tells them that one of the Black Ajah confessed to her. She states that she is not a Darkfriend and tells them they will each have to reswear. Sheriam embraces the True Source and Egwene shields her. Berana cries out. Egwene questions Sheriam and tricks her into a lie. She tells Sheriam it was Verin who came to her. Moria tries to escape and she is caught as well. Each of the remaining Sitters reswears the Oaths proving themselves. Takima asks if there are others and Egwene replies that there are over two hundred, seventy in the rebel camp. They will seize them one Ajah at a time. Bryne will set up a perimeter for sisters and Warder who try to escape. Once the camp is cleansed, the army will begin the assault on the White Tower that evening. She tells them to pass the word. The news will be a distraction to cover their work.</p>

<h2>Ch 44, Scents Unknown, Wheel and Snake</h2>
<p><strong>Nynaeve.</strong>  Hurin, love that Sniffer. Rand is a little ready to kill everyone on the planet to stop the DO.. okie dokie. Nynaeve feels sorry for Rand, I get it. Who is this vital person in Cadsuane's plan?? Also love that we get this info about Min.. she views the Pattern... wow!! SO COOL!</p>

<p>Hurin tells Rand that he is there to set up a formal meeting. The Borderlanders want badly to meet with him, but they require that he come inside the guardian at Far Madding.</p>

<p>She goes to Cadsuane's room and finds her with Merise, Corele and Min. Nynaeve tells them that she knows where Perrin is, but demands to know the plan before she will tell. She tells them how badly the meeting went. Cadsuane mutters that she will teach him to laugh again. Corele says that none of it matters. Min's viewings indicate that they will win. Min disagrees and Cadsuane says she is right. Min views the Pattern, but if Rand loses the Pattern will be destroyed. Nynaeve describes the statue and Cadsuane says it is the amahn'rukane near the Jehannah Road. They will go for him right now. She then accedes and answers Nynaeve's question. They are not after Perrin. They are after someone with him.</p>

<h2>Ch 45, The Tower Stands, Flame</h2>
<p><strong>Egwene.</strong> Wow, what an honest sigh of relief. The White Tower, the full-real-smoldering-damaged White Tower has chosen to raise Egwene to the Amyrlin. YES!</p>

<p>Interesting aobut the Black Tower embassy, that slippery Taim! Romanda reports that there has been no word from the Black Tower embassy. In addition to the Sitters, the embassy included Nisao, Myrelle, Theodrin and Faolain. Why all women sworn to Egwene?</p>

<p>Also the sleepweavers are missing - Sheriam gave them away to that Forsaken (which I guessed was Mesaana but idk!).</p>

<p>They ride to the outskirts of Darein. They can see the White Tower, wounded but still standing. Bryne and Siuan are waiting. Egwene guesses correctly that she bonded him. Egwene tells Siuan that she is angry and that Siuan must regain her trust. Bryne leads her through Darein to the Alindaer Bridge so she can see the force of a thousand of the Tower Guard on the other side. The army can cut them down but it will be bloody. She asks Bryne if he agrees with the assault. He says it is not his place to make and opinion, but the rebels have lost the advantage of Traveling and the White Tower will never be weaker. It is time to either attack or give up and leave. Egwene says they will wait an hour. After that it will be too dark.</p>

<p>As she prepares to give the command, another group approaches. They are ten Aes Sedai led by Andaya Forae. The sisters comprise two Sitters from the Brown, Gray, Green, White and Yellow. Andaya announces that the Hall has chosen to raise Egwene to the Amyrlin. Elaida was taken by the Seanchan. Egwene demands and Andaya accedes that the army may enter the city, the rebels will be accepted back and the Blue Ajah reinstated. Egwene feels joy and satisfaction as she rides into Tar Valon.</p>

<h2>Ch 46, To Be Forged Again, Wheel</h2>
<p><strong>Egwene.</strong> These days will be LEGEN - wait for it - DARY! Oh yes, Egwene raised as Amyrlin.. again lol and Silviana raised as Keeper, awesome! </p>

<p>She tells Siuan to have the rebel Aes Sedai report to the Sunset Gate to apologize for rebelling. When Egwene is ready, she opens the door to find Gawyn waiting. She tells him to wait, to his displeasure, and goes to the Hall. She gasps when she sees a large hole in the wall through which she can see Dragonmount. There are only eleven Sitters including Saerin (Brown), Doesine (Yellow), Yukiri (Gray), Seaine (White) and Suana (Yellow).Talene fled months ago. Velina and Sedore are missing; they were on Verin's list. Evanellein is also missing making her a suspect as Black Ajah. All three Red Sitters are missing. Duhara left some weeks before on a mission for Elaida. Javindhra and Pevara just disappeared.</p>

<p>Egwene asks Tesan if Silviana is still imprisoned. She replies yes, but says the Leane was freed to join the others at the Sunset Gate. Egwene sends her to bring Silviana. Saerin issues the call and Yukiri, Seaine and Suana stand for her. Saerin then calls for the vote and all rise. Egwene is raised to the Amyrlin. Tesan returns with Silviana. Egwene berates the Sitters for letting Elaida destroy the Tower. She says Silviana was the only one brave enough to stand up to her. She offers Silviana the position of Keeper of the Chronicles and she humbly accepts. Romanda and Lelaine will be livid when they learn that neither of them will be Keeper.</p>

<p>She chastises the Sitters again saying they all made mistakes, including herself, but they must now move forward to make the White Tower strong. They all move to the Great Square where Egwene addresses all the rebels and most of the others in the White Tower. She admonishes the rebels then tells them they must work hard to rebuild. The White Tower will once again be whole and complete. The Aes Sedai cheer as Egwene thinks how much work needs to be done.</p>

<h2>Ch 47, The One He Lost, Dragon</h2>
<p><strong>Rand.</strong> This chapter made me feel so many emotions... I could see Rand slipping and then Tam said "she told me to come talk to you" and oh no it was about to go down! This was beautiful, and heartbreaking. Rand is reminising over his life and wondering about the Choedan Kal and why they aren't in the Prophecies, and I agree... why? Where is Callandor?</p>

<p>He returns to his rooms and finds Tam waiting. Janduin was his real father but Tam raised him. Rand asks how Tam got there from the Two Rivers and Tam tells him he was with Perrin. Rand assumes Nynaeve went to the statue and brought back Tam. Perrin has been balancing the Seanchan, the Prophet, the Whitecloaks and the queen. Morgase is alive. Rand apologizes for losing Tam's sword. Tam says he earned it when he killed a man who needed killing, but he still never forgave himself. Rand tells Tam that he feels like a puppet, but Tam chastises him. He may not be able to choose what he does, but he can choose why he does it. Tam lets slip that it was Cadsuane who came to him, not Nynaeve, and Rand reacts with rage. He nearly kills Tam then in horror he opens a gateway to Ebou Dar.</p>

<h2>Ch 48, Reading the Commentary, Ornaments</h2>
<p><strong>Min.</strong> Oh shoot, Rand is about to do something BIG.. we are nearing the end of the book and the Sanderlanch is FALLING! </p>

<p>Min believes Rand is to use Callandor and "the three shall be one", seems to simple to be a circle, but I'm for it! Then Min views Nynaeve kneeling over someone's corpse in a posture of grief, great, who's dying?! Then Beldeine, a black kknife spun around her head.. FAIN, maybe lol.</p>

<p>Min says something is still wrong with the interpretation, something they have not discovered, and Cadsuane agrees. At that moment Tam bursts into the room in a fury. He demands to know what Cadsuane did to Rand. He says Rand tried to kill him. Min is terrified thinking of her own experience with Rand, but that had been Semirhage, not him. Tam tells Cadsuane that she has a lot to explain and she wraps him in Air. He tells her she is a bully and that irks her enough that she puts him back down. They argue, but Min senses that Rand is gone. The others ask where. She says he has gone to Ebou Dar to destroy the Seanchan.</p>

<h2>Ch 49, Just Another Man, Leaf</h2>
<p><strong>Rand.</strong> Whoa, Rand is struggling. Rand gateways to the top of Dragonmount. The sky is clouded above him and he weaves Air and Fire for warmth and to breathe and he sits down to think.. Rand was going to balefire the entire Tarasin Palace minutes ago.</p>

<h2>Ch 50, Veins of Gold, Dragon</h2>
<p><strong>Rand.</strong> Again, wow. Rand drew more saidin than when he cleansed the taint and didn't die or get burned out. He destroyed the Choedan Kal. So we won't get anymore LTT? Rand isn't mad anymore? Oh boy, this is what I wanted!! At least that's what I'm hoping for.</p>

<p>He remembers being Healed to find Ilyena dead by his own hand. Why must he live over and over? Lews Therin sounds completely sane when he answers that we live again so we can have a second chance. Rand remembers Tam telling him he can choose why he does his duty. If he lives again then he gets to love again. He wants to do it right this time. He remembers all the lives he lived before. He drives the One Power back through the access key to the male Choedan Kal and it explodes. The One Power winks out. Rand opens his eyes for the first time in a long while. He knows he will never hear Lews Therin again for they are not two men and never were. The clouds overhead break and he can see the sun. He smiles and laughs for the first time in far too long.</p>

<h2>Epilogue, Bathed in Light, Wheel</h2>
<p><strong>Egwene.</strong> Complete, Egwene is home.</p>

<p>Most of the Black Ajah in the Tower, over sixty, escaped including Evanellein. Saerin took a census after the attack. Forty initiates, over two dozen of them Aes Sedai, were taken by the Seanchan. Velina, Chai Rugan, Birlen Pena and Alviarin escaped. In reswearing the White Tower sisters, they only caught three more that Verin missed. From Verin and Sheriam, Egwene is convinced that Mesaana was in the Tower.</p>

<p>However, the list of women missing since the attack and not on Verin's list is short: Nalasia Merhan, a Brown, Teramina, a Green, and Jamilila Norsish, a Red. All three are very weak and have been in the Tower for years so they are all poor candidates to be Mesaana in disguise.</p>

<p>Egwene speculates that Mesaana knows how to defeat the Oath Rod. Idk about that.</p>
