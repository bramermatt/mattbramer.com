<h2>Written Review</h2>
<p>Why yes, I THOROUGHLY ENJOYED THIS ENTRY! This one struggled a bit for me being a middle book on a trilogy. A lot was resolved, but there was a lot left open.. obviously as this penultimate novel in a 15 book series. We are not done yet, and there is still something big to come! And there was even some plots STARTED this book.</p>

<p>A satisfactory entry into the series. This one certainly separates itself as primarily written by Brandon Sanderson. There are friendly cameos from friends of the Wheel of Time community. There are beautiful one-liners. Great action. The dialogue between the characters is just so crisp. Oh this was a great, and I keep saying entry, because it is - it is an entry into the Wheel of Time! </p>
    
<p>I am ecstatic to start A Memory of Light next week! Book thirteen complete, what's left.. book fourteen and I've left the prequel New Spring for after the series to complete my first read-through of The Wheel of Time!</p>

<h2>Started Reading</h2>
<p>I started reading this book on August 18, 2023!</p>

    <summary>Review Scores</summary>
    <p>I will say, I was very excited for this book, and I thoroughly enjoyed it - as I said. However, I give this a 4/5 for my scale of enjoyment. I really enjoyed the dialogue and the plot, and the world-building of course, but this book felt held back.</p> 

    <p>Obviously it had to be, being the second to last book, but there were certain parts of the story that I'll leave out in case you haven't read the book - I wasn't as emotionally satisfied. I wanted to be, but I couldn't be. There are still plotlines that drag down my enjoyment. I want to enjoy them, but there are characters and people groups  that aren't too very important to the story. </p>
        
    <p>That doesn't mean I don't love this book, I certainly do. But, after all of that, 4/5. </p>
        
    <p>Let's see how A Memory of Light finishes the series, and then New Spring after that!</p>

<details id="spoiler story breakdown">
    <summary>Spoiler Story Breakdown</summary>
    <p><strong>Lan</strong> has gathered over 12,000 from the Borderlands and has raised his title Lord of the Seven Towers, Defender of the Wall of First Fires, Bearer of the Sword of the Thousand Lakes. We leave Lan charging into battle with over 150,000 Shadowspawn at Tarwain's Gap..</p>

    <p><strong>Moiraine</strong> oh wow, Moiraine is back! Moiraine was kept in the Aelfinn and Eelfinn world and they fed on her Power and she is weakend, but she has an ivory bracelet angreal. Mat, Thom, and Noal (Jain Farstrider) saved her from the snakes and foxes. Moiraine and Thom professed their love and he mentioned he would be her Warder.</p>

    <p><strong>Noal</strong> turns out to be Jain Farstrider, and he sacrificed himself to help save Moiraine.</p>

    <p><strong>Elayne</strong> was able to reconnect with Galad, Gawyn, Mat, Thom, Perrin, and... MORGASE. Elayne has also borrowed the foxhead ter'angreal from Mat and was able to create copies of the ter'angreal in exchange for help with Aludra's dragons. Elayne now has the throne of Cairhien.</p>

    <p><strong>Morgase</strong> married Tallanvor.</p>
    
    <p><strong>Aviendha</strong> goes to Rhuidean and goes through the columns and then goes a second time.. and sees the future of the Aiel. She has a plan to help sto pthat from happening.</p>
    
    <p><strong>Nakomi</strong>.. who is this?! She has showed up and disappeared after talking with Aviendha. </p>

      
    <p><strong>Nynaeve</strong> OH MY GOSH, HEALS MADNESS and passes her test for the shawl and takes Lan's bond from Myrelle. </p>
    
    <p><strong>Egwene</strong> believes Rand is mad, intending to break the Seals and she summons armies wtih the intent to stop him. Egwene also bonds Gawyn as Warder! Egwene faces Mesaana in TAR in the reflection of Tar Valon and Mesaana and the Black Ajah are there. Egwene breaks Mesaana's mind in a battle of wills. </p>
    
    <p><strong>Perrin</strong> trains with Hopper in the wolf dream (which I'll come back to this), and finds a strange wall.. turns out to be a dreamspike setup by Slayer/Isam/Lord Luc. Perrin also was judged by Morgase against Galad and the Whitecloaks - they considered Perrin a Darkfriend for killing some Whitecloaks. Morgase declared guilty and gave over the punishment to Galad. Perrin then saved Galad and the Whitecloaks from a Trolloc attack. Perrin and Hopper steal the dreamspike and end up destroying the dreamspike from Slayer. Hopper is killed. Perrin learns not to fear the wolf inside him and reunites with Noam, the wolfbrother. Oh, Perrin had a lot this book. Perrin crafted a Power-Wrought hammer with the help of Neald, the Asha'man, and Wise Ones and now the Asha'man might be able to make more Power-Wrought Weapons - the Aiel really want those! Perrin also made steward of the Two Rivers. </p>
    
    <p><strong>Graendal</strong> was the one who sent Slayer and the dreamspike to Perrin, and is now punished by Shaidar Haran.</p>
    
    <p><strong>Olver</strong> wins a game of Snakes and Foxes, and now plans on killing the Shaido who killed his father. </p>
    
    <p><strong>Caemlyn</strong> is being seiged by Shadowspawn from the Waygate in Caemlyn.</p>
    
    <p><strong>Mat</strong> killed the gholam.. still means there might be 5 left right? Mat, Thom, and Noal entered the Tower of Genjei and saved Moiraine. Mat had his eye removed by the Eelfinn to give Moiraine her freedom. Using his ashandarei to open a doorway out of the Tower of Ghenjei. </p>
    
    <p><strong>Rand</strong> comes down from Dragonmount, and is changed. His presence makes all things better. He visits Egwene and announces he will break the Seals of the DO at the Field of Merrilor. Rand apologizes to his friends, and goes to restore order in Bandar Eban, he also helps save Bashere and Ituralde. King Alsalam is also found alive. Rand also meets with the Borderland monarchs. He is ready to start the Last Battle. </p>
    
    <p><strong>Wolf Dream vs TAR</strong> okay, so these have to be the exact same thing right?! It isn't fully written out on the page, but also Perrin can see Egwene and they can communicate with each other. So this HAS THE BE THE SAME THING! I'm just waiting to see this on the page.</p> 
    
    <p><strong>The Forsaken</strong> alive.. Damodred, Lanfear / Cyndane, Ishamael / Moridin, Moghedien, Graendal  and Sammael (thinking still alive). Dead.. Asmodeon. Balefired.. Rahvin, Semirhage, Balthamel, Be'lal, Aginor.</p>
    
    <p><strong>The Seanchan</strong> now have Travelling from Suffa.. Elaida. They plan to use Traveling to attack the White Tower again!</p>
    
    <p><strong>The Black Tower</strong> something is happening here. Androl is building a bit of a resistance against Taim. There must be a dreamspike at the Black Tower because no one can make gateways in or out of the Black Tower. HMMM.</p>
    
    <p><strong>Lanfear</strong> in the epilogue Rand hears a woman crying and Rand shows up and it's Lanfear.. She is scared. I think Lanfear might be being saved by Rand?!?! Interesting. </p>
    
    <p><strong>Field of Merrilor</strong> is the place Rand will meet with monarchs, the Amyrlin Seat Egwene, Perrin and his forces, The Band of the Red Hand, the Whitecloaks, also known as the forces of the Light.</p>
    
    <p><strong>Who Killed Asmodeon</strong> so, I watched <a href="https://youtu.be/lfOhlxYiKQs?si=6qu-XEt33Q7fP69w&t=2220" target="_blank">Wheel of Time - A Memory of Light reading / q&a session</a>, and you can watch this too. You'll have to look in the glossary... I won't spoil it for you.</p>

    <summary>Notes As I Read</summary>

    <h2>Header</h2>
    <p>
    "It soon became obvious, even within the stedding, that the Pattern was
    growing frail. The sky darkened. Our dead appeared, standing in rings
    outside the borders of the stedding, looking in. Most troublingly, trees fell ill,
    and no song would heal them.</p>

    <p>It was in this time of sorrows that I stepped up to the Great Stump. At first, I
    was forbidden, but my mother, Covril, demanded I have my chance. I do not
    know what sparked her change of heart, as she herself had argued quite
    decisively for the opposing side. My hands shook. I would be the last
    speaker, and most seemed to have already made up their minds to open the
    Book of Translation. They considered me an afterthought.</p>

    <p>And I knew that unless I spoke true, humanity would be left alone to face the
    Shadow. In that moment, my nervousness fled. I felt only a stillness, a calm
    sense of purpose. I opened my mouth, and I began to speak.</p>

    <p>—from The Dragon Reborn, by Loial, son of Arent, son of Halan, of Stedding Shangtai-</p>

    <h2>Prologue, Distinctions, Wheel</h2>
    <p><strong>Lan.</strong> Lan! Lan is riding Mandarb across the Proska Flats in northern Saldaea near the Blight. He hasn't seen people or Trollocs in days. Lan prepares an arrow and a man walks up leading a pack horse, he expected to see Lan on the Kremer Road, this is Bulen, Lan's retainer years ago in the Aesdaishar Palace.. nice name. Lan refuses, but decides once Bulen says his father was Malkier, Bulen needs permission to don the hadori, Lan relents and the two travel on.</p>

    <p>Perrin. Apparenlty Perrin is dreaming a normal dream.. hmm. Hopper is there. Perrin is thinking about Berelain and Faile. Perrin is now back in Malden carrying his axe instead of hammer.. he remembers the fight differently, he  refuses to kill Aram but then an image of Perrin splits off and turns into a wolf and kills Aram. Hopper slams into Perrin after Perrin makes more statues of people he knows. </p>

    <p>He wakes up and he is in his tent with Faile, there have been bubbles of evil that made red snakes poison hundreds, the Aes Sedai couldn't completely Heal them. It then takes Perrni a long time to go back to sleep.</p>

    <p><strong>Graendal.</strong> Holy smokes, this is how the DO uses rats as spies... hahaha for the entirety of this book series I assumed the rats could talk.... hahahahahah. Okay, this was incredible, unexpected and interesting! We are back in time, Graendal is in Natrin's Barrow with Aran'gar, Delana, and hundreds of servants. Graendal now has access to the True Power - the TP strains and scars the Pattern. What the Creator can create, the DO can destroy.</p>

    <p>Ramshalan comes in, Delana weaves Compusion on him. Graendal uses the True Power to take over the mind of a dove. Graendal wonders if LTT remembers her murder of Yanet. The dove sees Ramshalan, Rand, Nynaeve, and the Aiel. Rand weaves balefire and Graendal freaks out! Wraps Aran'gar and Delana in Air and opens a gateway with saidar. She jumps through and sees a flash of light and the gateway disappears. She feels the balescrem from the massive use of balefire. She is safe because Rand thinks she is dead. WHOA! Unexpected! - and yes I have to update my Forsaken count..</p>

    <p><strong>Galad.</strong> Okay, Galad was called a darkfriend by Asunawa. The Questioners arrested him. Asunawa fled when Galad beat Valda in KOD (I think.)</p>

    <p><strong>Padan Fain.</strong> Good-NESS lol. The creature formally known as.. Fain / Mordeth, yikes. The sky is black. Fain keeps cutting himself. He thinks he needs a new name. He just killed a Worm. They make a lot of noise. Then mist comes out of the ground and kills a Fade and turns the Trollocs with the fade into something crazy. Fain doesn't hunt Rand, he is going to meet him at Shayol Ghul and kill him! </p>

    <p><strong>Melanarin.</strong> Oh that was beautiful. Keemlin gets his sword before his nameday to become a MAN! Malenarin is commander of Heeth Tower, the northernmost tower near the Blight in Kandor. They use a cool system with mirrors and lamps to shout danger for nearby towers. Trollocs come in hordes! </p>

    <p><em>Also, dang it.. undulating count: 1. actually 2. 2 in one POV.</em></p>

<h2>Ch 1, Apples First, Dragon's Fang</h2>
<p><strong>Almen Bunt.</strong> I thought I recognized that name.. Bunt. THIS WAS THE MAN WHO HID RAND AND MAT IN THE EYE OF THE WORLD!! Wow, so cool. Also, Rand has a lightness around Rand now instead of darkness.. interesting. </p>

<p>Wind rises above the misty peaks of Imfaral, there are thirteen tall, black fortresses. Seanchan is in chaos. The Fields of Peace are burning and the Tower of Raves is broken. A murder rules in Seandar.. oh really??</p>

<p>The Wind blows to an apple orchard below Dragonmount. Almen Bunt is there. Everythign is hagard and wilting. People and names, apple are gross and rotting... Then Rand shows up, and my guess is Rand is going to see Egwene! Rand leaves in his path an abundance of healthy apples and green grass. Rand thinks who he goes to see will not be pleased, is he in for a rude awakening or what?!</p>

<p>Almen feels better than he has in years. He calls the farm hands to gather people from the villages, even those passing on Shyman's Road, to help pick the apples. He feels something tugging him after the young man, but he will take care of the apples first.</p>

<h2>Ch 2, Questions of Leadership, Wolf</h2>
<p><strong>Perrin.</strong> I do declare, the Pattern wants Perrin to bring an incredibly massive fighting force to Rand. The gateway boys won't be able to gateway for sometime - in my estimation, and Perrin's army is going to be HUGE. That is all. Also, "there is something you need to see".</p>

<p><strong>Galad.</strong> Asunawa = Dead. </p>

<p>Galad wakes from his beating. He has many sharp pains in addition to the still-healing wounds from Valda. He is in a tent bound to a stake. He hears voices outside the tent; the flaps open and, to his surprise, it is Trom, Bornhald and Byar. Lords Captain Kazere Tethow, Alaabar Harnesh and Brandel Vordarian are with them. After thinking through the arguments they decided Galad was in the right. They executed Asunawa and the Whitecloaks are now united behind Galad. Candeiar enters to tend his wounds. They will march to Andor.</p>

<h2>Ch 3, The Amyrlin's Anger, Flame</h2>
<p><strong>Egwene.</strong> Oh yes, here we go! Egwene wants Nynaeve and Elayne to swear on the OR - I agree. She also needs to let them know about Elaida (collared). She then dreams of Gawyn then BOOM.</p>

<p>Dreams of thirteen black towers (seanchan) falling down. Then eagles and snakes. Then An enormous sphere made of the finest crystal on a dark hilltop. It sparkles in the light of twenty-three enormous stars. There are cracks in it and it is help together by ropes. Rand walks up with a woodsman axe and chops the ropes. The sphere breaks apart, falling to pieces and Rand shakes his head. Which is awesome, I'm reminded of the Bore.. hope to see more of that.</p>

<p>Rand is here to meet Egwene.</p>

<p><strong>Siuan.</strong> Oh why yes, thank you! This is great! Rand is in the Tower. Gawyn is trying his best to rekindle the trust with Egwene. Siuan thinks Egwene is an incredible Amyrlin. Rand enters shielded by 26 Aes Sedai and guarded by 100 Warder. His eyes look ageless. Rand speaks to Siuan and Bryne and thanks Siuan for taking an arrow meant for him (TGH!). Tiana runs up and hands Rand a letter with a red seal.. interesting. Rand asks Siuan to calm Egwene once he leaves.. oh boy lol.</p>

<p><strong>Egwene.</strong> Oh this is so good! Rand comes in calm as can be. And proceeds to tell Egwene nearly everything she needs to know.</p>

<p>Rand speaks philosophically and Egwene worries that he is mad. She says she will have sisters examine him but he refuses. He tells her the last time he failed was because he used only men. It will take both saidin and saidar to seal the Bore. He says he remembers being Lews Therin like a dream.</p>

<p>He says he will go to Shayol Ghul in one month and break the remaining seals. He must clear the rubble, open the Bore fully, before it can be sealed again. He will meet them at the Field of Merrilor one day before. She thinks of her dream of him letting the sphere break. He asks leave to depart and turns to go. She sees his left hand is missing. After he is gone, the Sitters slump in their seats. Silviana, Barasine and Yukiri say could not speak for his ta'veren effect. Chubain reports that Bryne is following Rand to make sure he leaves. Egwene says they need allies to stop him from breaking the seals.</p>

<h2>Ch 4, The Pattern Groans, Pattern</h2>
<p><strong>Perrin.</strong> Hmm, Perrin riding Stayer is at the Jehannah Road with Faile, Wil, Seonid and the six Wise Ones, Nevarin. Berelain, Annoura Gallenne are also there. Alliandre stayed behind. A patch of the Blight has transplanted there. Mori examined the entire patch. They ride into the patch and find a strange village in the middle. Sulin reports that no one is there. Masuri says that the wood and thatch are something she has never seen. Perrin orders the Wise Ones to burn the whole area.</p>

<p>Oh wow, Perrin. I think I'm interested in your storyline now! Perrin wakes in the Wolf Dream! Perrin keeps fighting the urge to be his Young Bull wolf form. Perrin then sees visions - Mat fighting against himself, 12 different men wearing his face, a shadowy figure behind him comes with a bloody knife. - Sheeps running towards the woods chased by wolves, there is a terrible beaset in the woods and something is wrong with the wolves. - File, Grady, Elyas, and Gual followed by thousands walk toward a cliff. Whoa.</p>

<p>Perrin then chases a stag as Young Bull, bites it, then Hopper explains not to kill it here. And then Perrin agrees to let Hopper teach him his way... here we go!</p>

<p><strong>Galad.</strong> Oh heck, Dain Bornhald "he killed my father". Also, am I missing something, where is Morgase / Maighdin?? Is she not with Gill? </p>

<p>Galad is near the Jehannah Road... he has a message to send to the other Questioners about Asunawa - requesting they report to Galad. Also, Galad wants to ally with the Aes Sedai before the Last Battle - smart! Basel Gill is stopped by crew and they're seperating them all to see if their stories match up.</p>

<h2>Ch 5, Writings, Forsnaken</h2>
<p><strong>Gawyn.</strong> Dang it. I feel so simple-minded when I'm in Gawyn's head lol. He is going to do something very stupid... I feel it in my bones. Also, Mesaana is the assassin, I can't wait to find out who she has been masquarading as.</p>

<p>I'm interested in this plan for the AS bonding Warders. I think it's important - the Last Battle *is* coming..</p>

<p><strong>Egwene.</strong> Egwene, please don't turn people against Rand. The Seals are important to break, right? Also, why are you drinking mint tea Egwene?!</p>

<p><strong>Graendal.</strong> Whoa... Let's break this craziness down. Wow. I truly don't think Perrin will die. But who could her spies be?? Gotta be Dain Bornhold maybe, or Annoura?? oooo that'd be a twist!</p>

<p>Graendal is hiding on an island in the Aryth Ocean with only six of her pets, one a Tairen High Lady. A gateway takes her to Moridin's fortress. He is angry that Aran'gar is dead. Moridin says he will leave her without punishment and she wonders if that was a direct order from the DO or Shaidar Haran. he orders her to stay away from Rand, she says she will bring Perrin's head. She has spies and knows where his army is and she has planned a trap with her Shadowspawn army.</p>

<p>Moridin takes her to a storeroom with OP objects including three binders, a shocklance, a rema'kar, and a dreamspike - Moridin has two dreamspikes. Whatever the heck that means lol. A shocklance, we've heard that before TSR I think, Rand's Rhu visions. Moridin gives Graendal the dreamspike and warns her against using it against him.. and gives her the man with two souls.. SLAYER / LUC / ISAM! He tells her she will be greatly rewarded if she kills Perrin. He shows her a book of Dark Prophecies that says that Perrin will die. Moridin sends her back to the island, she can still touch the True Power a bit.</p>

<h2>Ch 6, Questioning Intentions, Blacksmith Puzzle</h2>
<p><strong>Morgase.</strong> Ask and I shall recieved.. Morgase! And so, we're sending a group to Cairhien, Edarra has suggested linking with the Asha'man to help with the gateways. The group to Cairhien includes.. Seonid, her Warder, two Maidens, Pel Aydaer, Cameaille Nolaisen, and Balwer lol, what a crew.</p>

<p>I love the interest Morgase has taken in serving drinks lol. Also, I certainly thought we were getting a marriage here! Tallanvor and Morgase sitting in a tree..</p>

<p>There have been a lot of chapters ending with.. "you've got to see this", "there's someone up the road", "and they knew just what to do..". Just an observation. Seems very middle trilogy book to me.</p>

<h2>Ch 7, Lighter than a Feather, Heron-Marked Sword</h2>
<p><strong>Lan.</strong> I'm not crying, you're crying... this is so good!!!</p>

<p>Lan and Bulen are riding, they have been for weeks - they're at the Plain of Lances near the border between Kandor and Saldaea. Lan bought Bulen a horse. Bulen suggests they go south, a much better raod - Lan declines. They ride past an inn, three men follow and they turn out to be peopel Lan used to command. Andere, Nazar, Rakim. Then two become five... for the Golden Crane!</p>

<p><strong>Galad.</strong> Oh boy, here we go - Byar is going to start on about how the Two Rivers is a place of Darkfriends.</p>

<p><strong>Perrin.</strong> Galad eats raisins.. Perrin eats HAM! See whos who here.</p>

<p><strong>Galad.</strong> Byar is a good storyteller it seems. His side of the story of course. </p>

<p><strong>Perrin.</strong> I do think Perrin will meet Galad. Let's fight, let's do this and let's kill Galad, or turn him to our side. Let's do it Goldeneyes.</p>

<h2>Ch 8, The Seven-Striped Lass, Dice</h2>
<p><strong>Mat.</strong> Ah, I struggled with that chapter lol. I was bored. Mat goes to taverns, dices, learns the gholam is in Caemlyn, Mat and Thom talk about the Tower of Genji, Elayne knows Mat is there but won't reply, Teslyn, Joline, and Edesina are going to return to the White Tower. Mat offers them horses. Mat lifts the tent flap and smells... blood.</p>

<h2>Ch 9, Blood in the Air, Wheel</h2>
<p><strong>Mat.</strong> Alright, this one was good.. "are you going to swear at her?" Mat, "of course I am, how is she going to know it's from me?!" haha.</p>

<p>The gholam killed Lopin, Riddem, and Will Reeve, and Gorderan and Fergin. Olver is fine. Mat wants to kill the gholam, they can't have it follow them to the Tower of Genji. They will leave as soon as his word to Verin is up. Mat needs to talk to Elayne and Aludra. Mat gives Joline horses to leave for the White Tower.</p>

<h2>Ch 10, After the Taint, Dragon's Fang</h2>
<p><strong>Perrin.</strong> Well that was fairly anticlimactic. Grady wants to see his wife and son, that sounds nice - too bad he's going to die before he gets to do that!lol I really don't know, just a prediction i'm throwing out.. Anyways, Perrin meets with Galad and demands his people back and Galad refuses unless they meet in battle. Perrin returns to his camp.</p>

<p><strong>Galad.</strong> Galad doesn't believe Byar's thoughts on Perrin, duh. But, Galad thinks Perrin is dangerous and wants to fight.</p>

<h2>Ch 11, An Unexpected Letter, Dragon</h2>
<p><strong>Elayne.</strong> Well boo, then yay, then eh lol. Elayne blah blah, Duhara (red) has been meetin gwtih Ellorien (Elaida's emissary)... then Mat writes a hilarious letter to Elayne - I look forward to them reconnecting. Mat asks for bellfounders. Elayne wants to take the Cairhien Sun Throne too, she will set up a meetin gwith Sumeko and Alise to discuss Traveling and the future of the Kin.</p>

<p>I look forward to seeing Mat and Elayne connect and Birgitte too. We have slowed this story way down it seems. Or maybe we're just in a school zone.. 25mph when I'd rather be going 45 - 50mph. Let's get a move on!</p>

<h2>Ch 12, An Empty Ink Bottle, Ornaments</h2>
<p>Maybe I'm just in a bad mood today for not getting much sleep, but YAWN. Alanna has disappeared with no trace of gateway, although not enough channeling for a gateway. Allana's belongings were gone leaving an empty ink bottle. There is an envelope sealed with red wax. Cadsuane thinks darkfriends could use Alanna to find Rand. Rand has been gone for three days. Bera brings some tea to Cadsuane and the tea tastes good... oh because Rand is happy not does that mean things are going to be better? With what he did with the Choedan Kal? That's neat! Ran has returned..</p>


<h2>Ch 13, For What Has Been Wrought, Aiel</h2>
<p><strong>Min.</strong> My heartstrings, they can't be tugged anymore! I WOULD LIKE TWO BOXES OF TISSUES PLEASE?? SO GOOD.</p>

<p>Rand is back, Min has viewings, an open cavern, gaping like a mouth - Shayol Ghul! Bloodstained rocks, two men dead on the ground surrounded by ranks of Trollocs, a pipe with smoke curling from it.. hopefully not Mat and Perrin.</p>

<p>Rand knows Alanna is gone, she might be in Arafel. He tells the Aiel he has toh and Rand requests Maiden guards at all times. Cadsuane is un-banished. Darlin is to assemble his forces. Rand promises to send help to Lan. Bashere, Min, Rand, and Nynaeve are to go to Arad Doman - Rand asks Min to keep working on understanding Callandor. Rand says he is not a weapon and never has been.. hmm. He asks Cadsuane for help finding someone in the Caralain Grass.. Perrin?</p>

<p>Weiramon and Anaiyella are darkfriends... hmmmm. Rand tells them to tell their associates that he is no longer blind.</p>

<p>Rand hugs Tam and cries and introduces Min as "someone very special to me".... AHHH I LOVE IT! </p>

<h2>Ch 14, A Vow, TAR</h2>
<p><strong>Egwene.</strong> Neat. Egwene meets with Nynave and Elayne and talk about life.. updates, yknow Black Ajah, Elayne being pregnant, Oath Rods, and Rand. Then BOOM TALVA AND ALVIARIN ARE THERE TRYING TO KILL EGWENE, but Alivarin ends up killing Talva instead. Egwene vows to find Mesaana. Also Egwene needs to use her skill of the Dream World more than channeling. Also, also, Egwene has requested Elayne and Nynaeve come tomorrow to swear on the Oath Rod. Also, also, also, they have to be Tested again. Neat.</p>

<h2>Ch 15, Use a Pebble, Pattern</h2>
<p><strong>Nynaeve.</strong> Well that was incredible. Nynaeve Healed the madness?! What?! THAT IS FREAKING AWESOME! Of course RJ / BS have an explanation for what the taint is doing to the mind.. thorn-like projections in the mind.. wow. Then Rands.. whoa, enormous black network with thousands of thorns, but there is a white lacing coating on the network - that is either the True Power or.. well, I really don't think I have an answer right now. Gotta be something to do with saidin and the cleansing and Rand destroying the Choedan Kal, hmm. I don't have an answer yet. Nynaeve will also Heal Narishma and Flinn - awesome. Also, Rand needs Nynaeve + another woman to help use Callandor.. who could it be?! Moiraine?? No, maybe! Maybe that grandmother.. who's name is completely escaping me (probs not her - but she was more powerful than Nynaeve right??).</p>

<p>Nynaeve Delves Naeff and finds a network of black veins with thorn-like projections in his mind. She pulls the thorns free and Heals the wounds. When the last one comes free the network shakes then vanishes. Naeff is now sane and no longer sees Fades following him. He rushes off to tell Nelavaire Demasiellin the good news.</p>

<p>undulating cout: 3.</p>

<p><strong>Egwene.</strong> Hmm. Who could Mesanna be?! This was neat, some more AOL things, I love that. </p>

<p>The clouds have returned to Tar Valon. Tea tastes stale and grain is spoiling. Egwene stands on the flat roof of the White Tower with Saerin, Yukiri and Seaine. She set them searching for information on Mesaana and defeating the Oath Rod. She quotes an ancient Brown scholar Yasicca Cellaech. Seaine has three theories on how to defeat the Oath Rod. Mesaana may have another Oath Rod that she can somehow use to negate the Oaths with an inverted weave of Spirit. She could have used Compulsion and the Mirror of Mists to have another sister swear in her place. Finally, she could have used a weave to alter her words so that what she actually swore to and what others heard are different. She orders them to keep working on it. Saerin reports that little is known about Mesaana herself. Marsim of Manetheren wrote about her. Alrom wrote about her schools. She was rejected as a researcher. Elandria Borndat wrote that she was more a direct leader than Graendal or Moghedien, sort of a Shadow Amyrlin. Lannis wrote that she was second only to Demandred in anger. She was angry at herself, the other Forsaken, the world that she was not the most important. She was an administrator who hated that position. She tried to deliver a broken White Tower and failed. She probably was part of Rand's kidnapping which also failed. Maybe also the women sent to the Black Tower which failed. Mesaana must need a great victory to regain her standing. Something like killing Egwene. Gawyn was mortified that she might use herself as bait, but she will have to do something to draw out Mesaana.</p>

<h2>Ch 16, Shanna'har, Puzzle</h2>
<p>I am bored. lol. Come on now, I am struggling with some of these chapters. There is A LOT of weak callbacks to the early books to touch on nostalgia and it feel shoehorned in. Maybe I'm just in a bad mood - idk. But Perrin is STILL TALKING ABOUT HOW HE IS NOT A LEADER. It's Whitecloaks this, wolves that, my wife this. boring. Perrin and Faile enjoy their anniversary, the shanna'har. Perrin tells Faile about the his wolf-side. Faile tells him about her captivity.</p>

<h2>Ch 17, Partings, and a Meeting, Lion</h2>
<p><strong>Mat.</strong> And the goodbyes are occuring, will we see any of these people again? Probably. Teslyn, Joline, and Edesina (to Tar Valon) with Juilin, Thera, Bayle Domon, and Egeaning too. They are sent with a message to the Amyrlin that Mat will come claim what is his.. he can't be talking about his Dagger can he?? no, he couldn't possibly! And Setalle is going to watch over Olver.. I don't doubt Olver will want to tag along, so we'll see if he stays with her.</p>

<p>I'm hoping this means Mat, Thom, and Noal are on their way to the Tower of Genji.. I'm not to assume we won't hear from Mat the rest of the book right RJ/BS?? RIGHT??! YOU WOULDN'T DO THAT TO US AFTER TAKING MOIRAINE AWAY FOR 8 BOOKS NOW... WOULD YOU? YOU WOULDN'T MAKE US WAIT MUCH LONGER... WOULD YOU?????</p>

<p><strong>Elayne.</strong> Alright Elayne, I agree with whoever said this before.. might've been Leon, but I think Elayne would've been a great Gray Ajah! Wow! What great negotiations skills ya sack of mashed potatoes.. whoa that was harsh lol. How about, great negotiation skills Elayne! I appreciate the fact that she thinks she is enormous lol. My wife being pregnant as well right now is making this fun.</p>

<p>Also, Elayne, come on... you can't put yourself in danger because Min said your babies would be born healthy, that doesn't mean anything for you - you could be captured by the Seanchan or even a Forsaken... you've been captured multiple times before!</p>

<p>Also, the Kin are looking to stay in Caemlyn and agree to provide Traveling and Healing.</p>

<h2>Ch 18, The Strength of This Place, Wolf</h2>
<p><strong>Perrin.</strong> I still really don't know fully what the wolf dream is, and obviously neither does Perrin. But this is good! This is good progress Perrin! Perrin is in the wolf dream, inspecting the WC camp, sees a signet ring with a winged dagger on it in Galad's tent. Hopper appears and Perrin can sense Oak Dancer, Sparks, and Boundless as well. Hopper teaching Young Bull how to use the wolf dream... finally! The strength of this place is his strength. They continue training and Hopper and Perrin stop when they find a translucent violet wall, Hopper says it is wrongness and the wall then vanishes. They continue training but Perrin is troubled. What the heck was that?!</p>

<p><strong>Ituralde.</strong> Am I very wrong in assuming that raken and Draghkar are similar?? Anyways, Ituralde and crew are protecting Mardon from Tollocs and Myddraal they've been fighting for week. Whoa! This was bloody. The Saldaeans will not help and will not let him into Maradon, treating his force as a foreign army. Bodies suddenly fall from the sky. The Shadowspawn have set up trebuchets and are launching dead Trollocs into their camp. Captain Finsas reports them moving more into place. Rajabi is taking command of part of the camp. Ituralde hopes that Rand keeps his promises. Another young officer is Zhell. Ituralde orders Lieutenant Nils to get a damage assessment and to tell Captain Creedin to guard the ford. Then suddenly there are live Draghkar among the falling bodies and they attack. One kills Rajabi. The Asha'man begin striking them down with balls of fire. Again Ituralde hopes that Rand will keep his promise to send help.</p>

<p><strong>Faile.</strong> I can safely say, this Berelain - Faile - Perrin mix has been my least favorite plotlines in the entire series. bar-none. I am so ready for Berelain to die or Faile to die or something to stop this childish nonsense. Isn't Faile like 16/18 and Berelain is older lol not really sure how old she is. Anyway, Berelain and Faile are planning to pretend to be friends. Not after Faile threatened to kill her in knife combat.. like they tried in TSR. Wow, die someone please. Although if Faile died soon, ohhhh I'd be pissed to, because we had what felt like 10 books at chasing Faile from the Shaido.. oh no, we are in a pickle now y'all. Who should die..</p>

<h2>Ch 19, Talk of Dragons, Dice</h2>
<p><strong>Mat.</strong> This was a perfect chapter. I love the way Mat, Elayne, Birgitte, and Thom interacted. Oh this was so good. Mat stumbling over his words as Elayne is showing confidence in being Queen, and Thom being proud of Elayne. OH so good I could cry. We have seen these kids grow up before our eyes! I mean, it's been a couple of years, but wow. I love this so mso much. Mat giving up the medalion for three days, I think we might be safe. I think. Thom as Royal Court Bard.. yes! Mat getting a title.. yes! I also love Mat and Thom together, father and son, it's so good.</p>

<p>They finally agree on a contact for the Band, the band gets one out of four dragons if they leave, and Mat lets Elayne have the foxhead medallion to study for three days. He feels naked without it with the gholam still around. He warns her about it. He is shocked again that she thinks she can copy it. She plans to Travel to Cairhien soon and Mat immediately realizes that that means the Sun Throne. She invites them to dinner. Talmanes and Dyelin will come as well. She also offers Thom a commission as official court bard. The commission includes a pardon for all crimes that he may have committed in Andor or Cairhien. Elayne has an appointment with her midwife before dinner.</p>

<p>what a line.. Mat, "I didn't do half of what they say, and the other half wasn't my bloody fault".. hahah</p>

<h2>Ch 20, A Choice, Star</h2>
<p><strong>Nynaeve.</strong> NYNAEVE'S BRAID! Oh noooo, what is she going to tug now. But holy smokes that was crazy! Did we really think Nynaeve wouldn’t attain her shawl?? Wow. Beautiful. Awesome. WHY IS BALEFIRE SO FROWNED UPON? Yes, the Pattern literally unravels a bit when used lol and a lot can go wrong, but the Last Battle is imminent y’all, let’s use it! Let’s learn it! Maybe I’ll change my name from sponge to (the last battle is imminent) lol. But whoa she did it. She has been raised AND she got Lan’s bond passed to her! Dang what a chapter!</p>

<p>SO GOOD: The Sitters finish their discussion. Saerin asks her to swear never to use balefire again but she refuses. She tells them that if she has to use it at Shayol Ghul with Rand then she will. Egwene warns them that refusing to raise the woman who helped cleanse the taint, who defeated Moghedien, the wife of the King of Malkier, would look very bad. Rubinde Acedone, Barasine and Lelaine vote no, but Yukiri, Seaine, Romanda and Saerin vote yes. Nynaeve passes the test, barely. They send her to her quarters for a night of contemplation before the ceremony the next morning but she has one thing to do first.</p>

<p>Nynaeve Travels to the Aes Sedai camp outside the Black Tower. They are still being made to wait for some reason. Nynaeve asks directions then goes to Myrelle's tent. She is there with one of her Warder, a big man with an Illianer-style beard. She tells Nynaeve to come back tomorrow but Nynaeve threatens her to get it done now. Myrelle weaves Spirit and Nynaeve can feel Lan in her mind. He is still alive. - this was actually pretty scary for me, because I AM SO SCARED OF THE BLACK TOWER! There have got to be so many darkfriends around.....</p>

<p>Also, undulate count: 4</p>

<h2>Ch 21, An Open Gate, Trollocs</h2>
<p><strong>Perrin.</strong> Apparently WE ARE GOING TO KILL SOME WHITECLOAKS.. LET'S GO! But Perrin is right, these people could help fight the DO at the LB. So, this is interesting.. If there is an alliance with the Seanchan it will end when the Car'a'carn is done and there will be blood feud.</p>

<p>Also, Perrin's picture has been passed around. Also, also, Perrin wants to go to Andor to talk with Elayne - I don't see that as much as a happy reuinion as Mat's.</p>

<p>Can someone help me with a timeline here? This Perrin stuff is like weeks / months prior to Rand telling Tam about Min right? Because how can Tam be in two places, or even be brought to Rand without anyone noticing.. "Perrin realized he wasn't getting any more tea".. hahahaha</p>

<p><strong>Ituralde.</strong> AWE-SOME STUFF. I love the way these battles are being written. I LOVE IT. I'm having so much fun reading. Trollocs are overwhelming Ituralde's army and pushing it back to Maradon, Ituralde gets his leg broken and then the gates of Maradon open and horsemen ride out to the rescue! The Saldaean commander is Yoeli, he tells Ituralde that this rescue will probably cost him his life.</p>

<p>I like that.. "Minds' for wolf-headed Trollocs, "Horns" for goats, "Beaks" for hawks, "Arms" for bears. The Minds were more intelligent, able to speak the human language to bargain with or trick their opponents - I have to check what type Narg was (tEOTW)!</p>

<p><strong>Morgase.</strong> Well this was beautiful. Morgase is stunned by the revelation about Gaebril. Taringail had tried to use her. Valda as well. Tallanvor finds her to say he is going to Tear. Thom and Gareth Bryne loved her, but not like Tallanvor. She tells him about Rahvin. She asks him not to leave yet and he agrees.</p>

<p>I think I should've kept track of "tempest" as well, as some of you may know the Stormlight Archive and the tempests there.. lol</p>

<h2>Ch 22, The End of a Legend, Dice</h2>
<p><strong>Gawyn.</strong> That was hilarious. Gawyn opens the door and an explosion of light and sound and he is wrapped in Air.. Egwene is awake, dressed, and very displeased... hahahah. Prior to that, Gawyn and some Younglings talked and some of them don't want to be Warder - they might be able to be Tower Guards, thanks to Gawyn. Then Gawyn asked advice from Bryne - nothing there but telling Gawyn to back off Egwene. Also, Bryne has maps and such around his room preparing for Trolloc attacks, there is a village near Dragonmount circled, also the Field of Merrilor is marked on the maps near the border of Shienar. Gawyn also chases an assassin but the person vanishes, gray-man? or Fain?! probably not Fain.</p>

<p>Also.. Boar Rushes Down the Mountain!</p>

<p><strong>Mat.</strong> Mat is awesome. Thom is awesome, heck even Noal is awesome. Love this conversation about the Tower of Ghenjei (wow I've been spelling that wrong...) lol. Thom thinks a deal can be made with the A&E to trade for Moiraine. Also, Mat kills some cutpurses and then another who recognized Mat. Mat thinks Birgitte will know more about the A&E!</p>

<p>Noal joins him and says Mat will soon be more famous than Jain Farstrider. Thom comes in disguised as a Murandian. They have not learned anything useful about the Tower of Ghenjei. Thom says the Aelfinn and Eelfinn made a deal with the Aes Sedai. If he can learn what they did, maybe he can trade it for Moiraine. They will take lanterns, torches and fireworks from Aludra. Thom has some hand drums and cymbals along with his flute and harp. Noal has some iron swords and knives and a band of iron for Mat's ashandarei.</p>

<p><strong>Birgitte.</strong> Holy smokes - that was a lot. Elayne is enjoying a play, hopefully someone doesn't hurt her while she's enjoying the play.. Birgitte has led many lives but never been a Warder before, she is sad she can't remember much of Gaidal. Mat meets with Birgitte after being taken by her guards and they go to The Grand Hike inn and the inkeeper is Snert. Mat asks about the Tower of Ghenjei and Birgitte warns him.</p>

<p>Aelfinn snakes, Eelfin foxes! Birgitte went there once as Jethari Moondancer, after the battle of Lahpoint Hills where she led the Buchaner rebellion, Gaidal was wounded and she took him there to be Healed. The Eeflinn killed them both after they were lost in the Tower for two months. They feed off emotion and they particularly like Aes Sedai. Birgitte tells Mat that he needs to get the the Grand Hall in the Tower. Iron to bind, fire to blind, music to dazzle.. I CAN'T WAIT!</p>

<h2>Ch 23, Foxheads, Darkfriend</h2>
<p><strong>Elayne.</strong> Well, whoa now. Mellar has escaped with the copy of the foxhead ter'angreal.</p>

<p>Elayne is at the play but she focuses on the foxhead medallion and the copy she made. It fails to work with more powerful weaves, plus she cannot channel when holding it. She can channel when holding the original.  Elayne recalls that Ispan seemed to be under some sort of Compulsion. Elayne suddenly has an idea how to get around that problem. Birgitte will not like it but she is not there.  Kaila Bent tells her that Birgitte is with Mat. In her rooms, she dons a black cloak and weaves Fire and Air for the Mirror of Mists to disguise herself as something creepy. She feels safe visiting the Black Ajah alone because of Min's viewing. She Travels to Chesmal's cell in the dungeons and pretends to be a Forsaken. Chesmal is taken in and tells her one of the two they seek, Mat, is in Caemlyn and they are planning an assassination. They are almost in position for the invasion of Andor.</p>

<p>Elayne no longer feels the Kin holding Chesmal's shield. The cell door opens and it is the secretary, Temaile and Eldrith. Eldrith sees through the sham. Elayne manages to shield Eldrith and Chesmal but the secretary attacks her breaking her shoulder. She knocks him away with Air but he gets the foxhead medallion from her.</p>

<p>Using all the One Power she can muster, she pulls the ceiling down on top of him. He ducks away and runs dropping one medallion. It is the original. Birgitte and Mat arrive and report that the guards and Kin outside are dead. They take Elayne to Melfane.</p>

<p><strong>Gawyn.</strong> This blade, with the three bits of blood-colored rock embedded, have we seen that beofre?? Anwyay, Egwene is mad at Gawyn for springing the trap, Gawyn then leaves to go to Elayne in Caemlyn - through the Traveling ground Egwene has setup.</p>

<p><strong>Lan.</strong> Yep, more of this please?! Lan is incensed when he sees Nazar tuck a golden crane banner into his saddlebag. They are in eastern Kandor near the border of Arafel. Bulen gets breakfast ready. Lan sees several new tents in the camp and eight men talking with Andere. Three appear Malkier and five Shienaran. Andere introduces the Malkier as Weilin Aldragoran, Managan and Gorenellin. The Shienarans are Qi, Joao, Merekel, Ianor and Kuehn. Andere met them earlier and sent them ahead to wait on this roadway. Rakim found them last night. The Malkier merchants sold all they could and brought two dozen wagons of supplies and a dozen warhorses. Lan agrees that they can come, but swears them to silence. They will pose as a caravan of merchants. The five have become dozens.</p>

<h2>Ch 24, To Make a Stand, Wolf</h2>
<p><strong>Elayne.</strong> Bed-rest, good. Birgitte reported that Mellar, Shiaine, Marillin, and Falion escaped and the secretary was murdered. Elayne gave mat his foxhead medallion back, and he wants to talk to Ealyne about the gholam.. hmm, what is he going to say about that?</p>

<p><strong>Ituralde.</strong> Rodel Ituralde is a good man, put that on his tombstone if he ever dies. Wow. Ituralde has been Healed by Asha'man Antail... Vram TOrkumen appointed lord of the city in Tenobia's absence is not a fan of Ituralde and Ituralde calls him out for it - names him a Darkfriend and hopes that he burns for the men he lost. Yoeli asks about the Asha'man and gateways, Ituralde knows this is about communications and supplies and neither Yoeli or Ituralde will use them to escape. Also  Yoeli's sister Sigril leads the Lastriders to the southeast who will ride with the news if Maradon falls. Queen Tenobia took many troops with her when she left to search for the Dragon Reborn. Yoeli and many others carry a black and yellow pendant called the Traitor's Banner. Ituralde thinks of an Old Tongue phrase, Desya gavane cierto cuendar isain carentin ("A resolute heart is worth ten arguments."). His rescue came only after fighting among the Saldaeans.</p>

<p><strong>Perrin.</strong> SLAYER! So this has got to be the World of Dreams, but I just can't fit all the pieces together. I'm excited to hopefully learn more. Also, Elyas doesn't go in the wolf dream.. hmm.</p>

<p>In the wolf dream, Perrin starts at his camp by the great sword impaling the ground. He calls for Hopper but gets no response. He searches the Whitecloak camp again but learns nothing new. Balwer did not recognize the Lord Captain Commander's signet. Perrin thinks he is an honorable man. He senses Oak Dancer's pack, Boundless, Sparks, Morninglight and others. They lead him on a chase to the Mountains of Mist but he cannot catch them. Hopper appears and tells him he is in the dream too strongly, to remember Faile. He practices moving to where the wolves are and finally gets it right. The wolves laugh and he feels like he did when cousin Wil dropped a bucket of wet feathers on him. He practices following and changing his surroundings. He moves again and he is on the side of Dragonmount. The next move takes him back to the Jehannah Road. There is a howl of pain and Morninglight dies, killed by Slayer. Perrin goes there and attacks the man who looks like Lan. Slayer is much stronger, more proficient in the wolf dream and Perrin barely escapes alive. Hopper is angry that a foolish cub attacked a lion. Perrin says he must learn to face Slayer. The Last Hunt is upon them.</p>

<p>Elyas approaches. Elyas chose to leave his life for the wolves. Perrin does not want to and Noam had to. Elyas only has a scent of worry. He says he stays away from the wolf dream. Perrin tells him to alert Tam and the others. They will meet the Whitecloaks tomorrow. He wonders about his vision of wolves running sheep toward a beast and wonders if it is the Whitecloaks.</p>

<h2>Ch 25, Return to Bandar Eban, Sea Folk</h2>
<p><strong>Min.</strong> And now we have Jesus Rand lol. Wow, it's so hard to unsee now hahaha. Min has some viewings, and they are just great, this was such a nice happy chapter lol.</p>

<p>Dark clouds pushed away by the sunlight's warmth. Rand, a brilliant white sword held in his hand, wielded against one of black, held by a faceless darkness.Trees, growing healthy and full. An inn in the Two Rivers with the mark of the Dragon's Fang inlaid on the door, a sign of victory and hope, not darkness or hate. A silver axe, the man will be a leader in the Last Battle. A woman will be trained in the White Tower and become Aes Sedai. Another man will save her life.</p>

<p>Rand goes to the man Min saw as a leader, Durnham. He was in the King's Guard before the king disappeared and Lady Milisair Chadmar disbanded them. Rand names him Captain and tells him to gather others. He spots Votabek and Redbord. Rand orders Naeff to bring weapons, armor and uniforms from the Stone. The men agree that Lain will not pay them so they will work for Durnham. In an hour Rand has five hundred soldiers and they have uniforms and armor. Rand then orders Naeff to bring Aes Sedai for Healing the sick. They go to the docks next. The harbor is full of Sea Folk vessels. Iralin still runs the docks. Lady Milisair Chadmar fled an hour after Rand left and the other Council of Merchants members within a day. They go to one of the ships, the Whitecap to speak to the Sailmistress Milis din Shalada Three Stars. There are spills sacks of spoiled grain on the deck. Rand opens a new sack and the grain is fine. Rand names Iralin to the Council of Merchants and orders him to distribute the food. He then names Iralin Steward of the city and Durnham his Captain. Rand says he will spend a day there to get things stable before he leaves.</p>

<h2>Ch 26, Parley, Whitecloak</h2>
<p><strong>Perrin.</strong> I think we're going to get a parley folks. Why would the Asha'man gateways not work?? Perrin sends off some warning booms and such, and requests to speak to Galad, Perrin doesn't want to fight until he understands what all is goin on. The air smells wrong, Slayer is around, and I'm just here to see Galad.. or Dain Bornhold dead! BRING ME HIS HEAD! Also, Perrin is using the Hammer now. </p>

<p><strong>Galad.</strong> Morgase has finally revealed herself, thank you Galad. And we are going to get a mother-freaking Whitecloak Darkfriend trail against Perrin judged by the very own Morgase Trakand! WOO! What a twist! I'm excited. I love Galad here... "Perrin must not have ever been to a formal parley before" after serving tea.. hahahaha. Let's goooooooo! Also, Galad is shook by Berelain lol. </p>

<h2>Ch 27, A Call to Stand, Flame</h2>
<p><strong>Egwene.</strong> Nice - Egwene has power over the monarchs of the world (including Rand), and the Hall has power over the army. No more Hall meetings in secret.</p>

<p>She moves to add to Tower Law that all Sitters must be in the Tower or appoint surrogates, all Sitters and the Amyrlin must be notified of all meetings of the Hall. The Sitters stand for the Greater Consensus. Egwene and Silviana return to her study and Egwene sends Nissa and Nicola to Caemlyn to get new dream ter'angreal from Elayne. Egwene will train them and others but only some. Rosil will not let her put them in danger. Silviana tells her that Gawyn is in Caemlyn. She orders a message sent for him to return. Even though he is infuriating she will need him.</p>

<h2>Ch 28, Oddities, Trollocs</h2>
<p><strong>Faile.</strong> Faile is angry that Morgase didn't tell her who she was. Faile also thinks she can use the way Berelain looked at Galad to her advantage. Perrin goes to sleep - literally just like me. I could sleep anywhere and I fall asleep so quickly lol.</p>

<p><strong>Perrin.</strong> Ahhh the Tower of Ghenjei! Hopper tells Perrin to stay away from the Tower, that's where Perrin woke up in the Wolf Dream. The colors don't swirl in the wolf dream. ... I AM PUMPED TO GET MORE WOLF DREAM! </p>

<p>Hopper vanishes and Perrin now easily follows. They are on the Jehannah Road and the violet dome is there. Oak Dancer, Sparks and Boundless are trapped inside with Slayer. Perrin tries to pass through but it knocks him down. Hopper is stronger and makes it through. Perrin runs through it, collapsing but quickly recovering. Sparks is wounded. Hopper goes to distract Slayer while Perrin rescues Sparks. He finds the wolf, returns to the edge of the dome and jumps through. Slayer appears just inside the dome with a drawn arrow and Perrin shifts to Dragonmount. The wolves there greet him. Slayer does not follow. Hopper sends that Whisperer is dead. Perrin and Hopper will practice every night until he is strong enough to face Slayer.</p>

<p><strong>Ituralde.</strong> Oh, so it's called The Great Serpent.. that's awesome! I love that actually. And oh shoot... DREADLORDS - also a cool name, thanks RJ. Oh yes, Ituralde is climbing up my list of favorite characters, looks like I'll need a main character, secondary, and tertiary character list!</p>

<p>Rodel freaking Ituralde man, whoa! This is an incredible group of soliders commanded by an incredible Great Captain, wow.</p>

<p>A boy brings word that Captain Yoeli needs him on the wall. Ituralde finds him with full Asha'man Deepe Bhadar. There are thousands of Trollocs camped around the city. Deepe reports that he can feel at least six men channeling down there, something powerful. then... boom Ituralde is on the ground, right eye severely damanged there is a holl in the wall, Deepe is maimed and missing a leg. Connel, a guard, brings Ituralde to a sick tent where Antail weaves something that gives Ituralde strength, but later he will be VERY EXHAUSTED. Then Heals Deepe. They then use Cordamora Palace as headquaters, the city is in chaos and Trollocs are crossing the moat and Ituralde plans retreat, but Yoeli pleads him to stay - apparenlty Yoeli's sister is coming.</p>

<p>Ituralde sends Tymoth, second in command after Deepe, and the other Asha'man except for Antail to defend the hole in the wall. They defend for nearly an hour. The Dreadlords do not participate.  The Asha'man abandon the wall and the Trollocs enter the city down the main avenue. It is a carefully laid trap. Arrows rain down on the Trollocs and the remaining Saldaean cavalry tramples them. The remaining Trollocs flee and Ituralde plans another trap.</p>

<h2>Ch 29, A Terrible Feeling, Wheel</h2>
<p><strong>Faile.</strong> Ah dang, Berelain is still alive lol. This has taken quite the turn for me hahaha, maybe I don't really want Berelain dead, but it would be interested, right? lol. Anyways, the trial of Perrin is two days away and BOOM bubble of evil that takes every weapon in the camp and starts to attack you - dirt stops the weapons.</p>

<p><strong>Morgase.</strong> Oh this is good. Morgase, is a smart woman. Also, I love Perrin. I know he's boring and his storyline has been dragged and dragged and dragged but he is the most honest character we have - I think. I don't know, i'm just finding Perrin be the same Perrin as he has been since we met him. He's a good man. Also, Galad is stuck on this black/white - everything is black and white. Morgase, I think she talked some sense into him! Also also, Perrin has requested an extension on the trial date - to tend his wounded.</p>

<p><strong>Perrin.</strong> Healing will take days - Galad will "think" on delaying the trail. Perrin wonders why his hammer didn't come alive.. I have a theory! Tam says Rand needs him, and Tam promises to be at the Last Battle - we're close to matched up timelines now, and Tam heads off, the Aes Sedai need him. </p>

<p>Bubble of Evil Theory: could it be, something or someone in the World of Dreams "in the flesh" that are picking up things or changing things.. oh now that I start this - I need to think more. I assumed it had something to do with Slayer in TAR messing but there would need to be a lot of people in TAR in the flesh, doing things. so maybe my theory has no legs...</p>

<p><strong>Elayne.</strong> Ahh, we are gearing up for a brutal Last Battle. Birgitte has a feeling that something terrible has begun with the creation of these cannons (dragons).</p>

<p>Complying with Melfane's order, Elayne has a makeshift bed carried atop the city wall near the road to Aringill to see the dragons. News from Cairhien is that all the noble Houses claim to be eagerly awaiting her, Daes Dae'mar fully in effect. She has to find a way to take the Sun Throne without getting into their politics. On the tower Aludra waits with a model dragon. Mat explained that all she wants is vengeance on the Seanchan. Elayne remembers her from Luca's circus. She intends to have Norry keep an eye on her. She heard the first tests last night. Birgitte waits with her while the test is set up. Dummies are set up on a far hill. She has another copy of the foxhead medallion with her. The test proceeds and the dragon goes off with a thunderous roar. The first shot misses but the second destroys most of the dummies. Elayne and Birgitte are amazed at the potential and Elayne offers Aludra the resources of Andor. Birgitte has a feeling that something terrible has begun.</p>

<h2>Ch 30, Men Dream Here, Wolf</h2>
<p><strong>Faile.</strong> Sneaky Faile. I get it, she loves Perrin, but this isn't what he wants! </p>

<p><strong>Perrin.</strong> Oh yeah, Perrin is awesome... or maybe it's Young Bull that's awesome??? OH OH! Anyways, Perrin is learning more about the wolf dream - hey me too buddy. Then they go to Caemlyn to find the nightmares of men.. Perrin falls into a woman's nightmare about Rand (the dragon reborn).</p>

<p>Then Perrin wants to find another but Hopper says the moment is here. The Last Hunt begins or does not. The decision will be made. They go to Dragonmount and there is a huge storm and lots of wolves. Perrin is drawn to the clouds above. Hopper cannot follow any higher. When he is a dozen feet from the top Perrin sees a faint reflection of Rand in the real world. Tendrils of black wrap around him. Suddenly, a sliver of light comes out and the web of black begins to crack. Then it explodes in brilliant light and the storm vanishes. Rand stands in the middle of the light and the wolves howl in victory. The Last Hunt has come.</p>

<p><em>undulate count: 5.. 6 (two in this chapter, like 2 paragraphs apart lol)</em></p>

<h2>Ch 31, Into the Void, Dice</h2>
<p><strong>Mat.</strong> Let me just say this.. this feels like this was completely written by Brandon Sanderson. Not just the inn, The Dusty Wheel, and Hatch the inkeeper - and maybe that clouded my judgement, but this was an incredibly exciting action sceen that was quick and to the point and led to a great finish. Just my thoughts..</p>

<p>The gholam is.. dead? Mat fought the gholam with his ashandari with a medallion attached and two copies in his pocket - they had an expertly laid out plan to "kill" it. Mat kicked it into a gateway, into the void! Mat plans to give the extra medallions to Olver and Tuon. Mat and Talmanes claim combat pay from the Crown for ridding the city of the gholam. Honestly, I didn't think this was going to happen - I thought Talmanes was going to die going into the burning building and Mat was going to kill the gholam with the medallions - I'm happy how this turned out!</p>

<p>THE DUSTY WHEEL! Holy smokes,the rumor wheel, best place in caemlyn to listen to rumors: most of them were untrue , but that was half the fun! And Hatch the inkeeper... aw Matt Hatch from The Dusty Wheel has a cameo! </p>

<h2>Ch 32, A Storm of Light, Trollocs</h2>
<p><strong>Ituralde.</strong> Well dang, that was awesome. Ituralde was saved by Bashere and his men... Rand appears and asks Ituralde for forgiveness for not sending help sooner, and admits he failed the truce with the SC. Rand then says the Shadow won't have Maradon and opens a gateway and two Maidens Travel outside the city to the north.</p>

<p>Rand channels and people are amazing, Naeff (AM) can't believe what he is seeing, so many weaves at once - they hear a scream nearby. Rand is using Deathgates and there is a light around Rand and so much. It's awesome. Rand stops and the towers are intact - it seems Rand only affected Shadowspawn and not anything else.. hmm. Turns out Torkumen has gone mad, his wife jumped to her death. They were Darkfriends driven mad by Rand's power - that is VERY INTERESTING. They couldn't even have seen what Rand was doing but, they felt it. Bashere then sends Vogeler to see that Rand is cared for.</p>

<p><strong>Min.</strong> AHHHH, King Alsalam! Sweet. I am interested in this Callandor business.. what is going to happen with that. Min reads - "Light is held before the maw of the infinite void, and all that he is can be seized." Then she talks Jendai Prophecy - " and the Blade will bind him by twain." Min thinks Callandor might make Rand weak, open to attack. Then when Rand, Min, Ituralde go into Cadsuane's room - they find King Alsalam, the White Tower had taken him apparently.</p>


<h2>Ch 33, A Good Soup, Lion</h2>
<p><strong>Siuan.</strong> I think this is a plotline that might be going on just a little too long. Yes, Mesaana is a Forsaken that has been killing people. Yes she is a terrible person. Yes they can't just leave her alone. I just wish we'd be able to get her soon - that is all. Also, Siuan likes her soup.</p>

<p><strong>Perrin.</strong> Perrin training montage in the wolf dream. </p>

<p><strong>Gawyn.</strong> Oh yeah, the Bloodknives we'd recently heard about! Gawyn toys with the assassin's knife he found when a woman gasps. Dimana, one of the Kin, leads several other women, one named Marille was a former damane. Marille says the knife is a Bloodknife carried by the elite Seanchan assassin Bloodknives. Gawyn demands to talk to any Seanchan officers to learn more. They bring Kaisea, a sul'dam of the Low Blood. Kaisea tells him Bloodknives wear ter'angreal rings that blur them into shadow but slowly kill them. Gawyn is debating what to do when a servant brings a letter from Tar Valon. It is a letter from Egwene demanding that he return. Instead, he sends back a message about the Bloodknives.</p>

<h2>Ch 34, Judgement, Whitecloak</h2>
<p><strong>Perrin.</strong> I haven't finished this perspective yet.. but is Slayer using the dreamspikes?! THAT IS SO COOL! Oh that's definitely the dreamspike... that is awesome. I still don't entirely understand what the heck is going on and how it is connected with the waking world and TAR. I'm excited to rafo though.</p>

<p><strong>Faile.</strong> I seem to be really enjoying Perrin's plotline this book - it's almost like something to do with Perrin and the wolf dream is better than anything else lol. I seem to have been begging for more wolf dream things since EOTW. I'm pumped. Also, let's do this trial fair and square, no need for any trickary.</p>

<p><strong>Perrin.</strong> so, Perrin is guilty, but not punished yet.. Galad gets to choose his punishment, but not until after the Last Battle.. but Galad didn't tell Perrin what his punishment will be.. will we ever learn what it was? Also, I don't trust Byar or Bornhold.. whoa - they're off the handle.</p>

<p>Neald, Dannil and Grady join Perrin in the pavilion. Rowan Hurn goes to make sure the captives were released. Faile sits next to Perrin with Berelain and Alliandre nearby. The Aes Sedai and Wise Ones stand behind them. Galad, Bornhald and Byar sit on the opposite side. Perrin is charged with murdering Lathin and Yamwick. Perrin admits to killing them but says it was not murder. Byar tells the story of them arriving at the stedding and finding the remains of a camp and then seeing wolves. Perrin remembers images and scents of Egwene, Bela and Dapple. Hopper killing Lathin. </p>

<p>A second Whitecloak corroborates Byar's story. It is then Perrin's turn and he admits that their story is true. He says he can speak with wolves and that he lost himself when the Whitecloaks killed his friends. Bornhald then accuses Perrin of murdering his father. Perrin responds that the Horn of Valere had been blown and he rode along with Hawkwing on the same side as Geofram Bornhald against the Seanchan. Galad then questions Byar as to how he knew that Perrin killed Bornhald but Byar is adamant. </p>

<p>Perrin then challenges Byar that he offered to let Perrin and Egwene escape so he could murder them. Morgase asks if Perrin is done with his defense and he concurs. She pronounces him guilty citing Andoran law. Dannil and Azi al'Thone stand beside Perrin. As to sentencing she cites the Kainec protocol. She rules that the altercation was a fight between unauthorized mercenary groups meaning there are no innocents. Perrin killed illegally but it was not murder. As Galad is the closest responsible for the men who were killed she gives Perrin's sentencing to him. Perrin agrees to abide by his sentence, but not until after the Last Battle is done. After deliberation Galad agrees. Byar vehemently objects. Galad asks Morgase to accompany him but she goes with Perrin as he is returning to Andor. Galad does not tell Perrin what his punishment will be.</p>

<h2>Ch 35, The Right Thing, Wolf</h2>
<p><strong>Egwene.</strong> Egwene and Siuan plan for their meeting tonight to trap Mesaana. No news from Gawyn yet. Egwene prepares to go to sleep. </p>

<p><strong>Perrin.</strong> Let's get this Slayer slayed! Perrin is aprehensive of a trap that he feels is about to spring. He is going to the wolf dream to get rid of the dome and confront Slayer. He tells Faile to get his army to Whitebridge as soon as Traveling works again. Perrin also thinks Slayer is actually Lord Luc (YES YES PERRIN YOU'RE RIGHT!). It's not a coincidence they ran into Whitecloaks as soon as they finish with Malden, Slayer is back and they are close to where Perrin met Noam.. Perrin must face this!</p>

<p><strong>Galad.</strong> The Whitecloaks are on their way to Lugard. Bornhald is upset and Byar is insubordinate. Bornhald isn't certain Perrin killed his father. Perrin must be a Darkfriend as he killed Lathin and Yamwick - Galad says he should be a Darkfriend too since he killed a Whitecloak. Galad is troubled.</p>

<p><strong>Perrin.</strong> In fact, it was the dreamspike... sweet. Perrin almost got Slayer, but Slayer is smart. Slayer also enters the wolf dream differently than Perrin, which we've seen - he just steps into it, right? I think that might've been Winter's Heart maybe? Or maybe even Knife of Dreams.. anyways, Slayer killed Oak Dancer. I wonder if Elyas can come here - I think he mentioned not coming there anymore. Perrin then finds the dreamspike and takes it north, and north, and more north a few miles at a time.</p>

<h2>Ch 36, An Invitation, Sea Folk</h2>
<p><strong>Egwene.</strong> I agree with Egwene. Egwene is meeting with Windfinders, Aiel Wise Ones, and Aes Sedai in TAR. She is looking out for the long game. I think everyone should work together and be happy - that is all lol. An end of an Age is coming. Siuan then arrives and says the Black Ajah have attacked! Egwene takes control of the meeting and lays the platform that the three groups can benefit from each other. She argues the merits of each group training apprentices from the others. Finally, she argues that they must stand united at the Last Battle and against the Seanchan. With a tentative proposal on the table, the Windfinders leave to discuss it. The Wise Ones and Aes Sedai discuss the battle that may come.</p>

<p><strong>Perrin.</strong> So Perrin is taking the dreamspike near the White Tower.. What is that going to do to every single channeler in the area??! Also, Perrin keeps getting sliced.</p>


<h2>Ch 37, Darkness in the Tower, Darkfriend</h2>
<p><strong>Gawyn.</strong> Gawyn has had some time to contemplate his feelings toward Rand. Birgitte says Elayne is "asleep".. Aes Sedai business. Gawyn sprints to the Traveling room and an Aes Sedai opens a gateway to the White Tower and nearly slices his foot off.</p>

<p><strong>Egwene.</strong> Silly Perrin, dreamspikes are for the Forsaken lol. Shevan and Carlinya are dead - Alviarin and BA are here to kill. The Aes Sedai can't Travel. the sky is violet.. hopefully Mesaana is trapped as well.</p>

<p><strong>Perrin.</strong> Confirmation this is a dreamspike. Slayer confronts Perrin in Tar Valon - he goads Perrin but Perrin is amrt. Slayers says Luc hates Perrin but Slayer does not.. hmm. Slayer then attacks. Are we about to get a two kill special this chapter - Slayer and Mesaana?!</p>

<p><strong>Gawyn.</strong> Gawyn is in Egwene's quaters to protect her but two Bloodknives are there and Mazone and Celark are killed in the attack. Another assassin enters.</p>

<p><em>undulate count: 6</em></p>

<p><strong>Perrin.</strong> Go Young Bull! Slayer has the dreamspike now and Hopper is there. </p>

<p><strong>Egwene.</strong> This is freaking awesome. Egwene + Nynaeve killing Black Ajah sisters.. WOO! Then Mesaana appears and boom Bair shows up.. then boom the time for sneaking had ended.</p>

<p><strong>Perrin.</strong> Holy smokes.. Perrin talks with Egwene and Perrin literally stops balefire because he wills it to miss. HOLY COW. So the wolf dream is definitely TAR. Obviously, but it's not been stated outright yet. WOW. AMAZING. Perrin is so good at TAR now. Also, Hopper is in pain.</p>

<p><strong>Gawyn.</strong> Gawyn has killed the three Bloodknives. But, he is really injured. </p>

<p><strong>Mesaana.</strong> Well, that was awesome - a info dump about the dreamspike.. no Traveling in or out unless you're allowed to (sounds like it might be very helpful). Mesaana palces a weave on Katerine and sends her to find Egweene.</p>

<p><strong>Perrin.</strong> Let's go Perrin.. although Hopper might be gone for good now. Perrin sees a nightmare behind Slayer and he shoves himself and Slayer into it. .</p>

<h2>Ch 38, Wounds, Forsnaken</h2>
<p><strong>Egwene.</strong> Well dang, in TAR it is about your own control of your will. Nicola died trying to intervene. Egwene kills Katerine thinking it was Mesaana - Mesaana then appears and snaps an a'dam on Egwene and takes her to her room. Egwene thinks about what Perrin taught her about relying less on channeling. Mesaana questions Egwene about the dreamspike and Egwene denies the a'dam and it's pain and TAR is a test a wills and Egwene is the Amyrlin.. and something snaps in Mesaana and she collapses. Mesaana is alive but her mind is gone. Bair says she saw something similar in Wise One Sammana. Something in her dream snapped her mind and she never recovered. The others fled and the battle is done, but the dome is still there. They all leave the dream.</p>

<p><strong>Perrin.</strong> And so it happens... Perrin takes the dreamspike - stabs Slayer - throws the dreamspike into a river of lava and the nightmare vanishes, the dreamspike is destroyed. Slayer still has more strength and begins kicking Perrin, Perrin feels Hopper dying and with his last thought he tells Perrin to seek Boundless. Perrin leaves the wolf dream. WOW. But, Slayer is still alive.</p>

<p><strong>Egwene.</strong> Love it! Freaking terrifying for Egwene to wake up and BOOM 5 DEAD BODIES AND BLOOD ALL OVER YOUR ROOM haha so scary lol. And Gawyn was right, also Egwene isn't too competent at Healing (not the Nynaeve 5 Powers kind), and he saved her life. She never got his message and she bonds Gawyn as her Warder and she wants to marry him... love it!</p>

<p><strong>Perrin.</strong> They are gone from that place. The air still smells wrong like the Blight. But they're gone. They arrived in Whitebridge. Perrin's wouldn't weren't to be Healed until he awoke. Grady, Neald, Gaul, Elyas, and some Maidens are all that are left in the camp before they left. Through the gateway the air smells clean again. </p>

<p><strong>Graendal. </strong> Aha, Slayer is kneeling at Graendal's side - he is resentful and barely under control. She tells him to spring the trap anyway. She has one remaining tool to use carefully. She thinks it is not yet done Fallen Blacksmith - that's what she calls Perrin.. whoa.</p>

<h2>Ch 39, In The Three-fold Land, Aiel</h2>
<p><strong>Aviendha.</strong> What the heck was that?! Who is Nakomi... hmm, do we trust her? Aviendha is running through the Aiel Waste to get to Rhuidean to walk the glass columns and complete her Wise One training. She stops and with no warning an Aiel woman appears - my first though, Lanfear, and she is friendly and can't channel - so Aviendha can tell. Her name is Nakomi, and she is humble and asks questions about Rand and the future of the Aiel. Aviendha thinks the Aiel must return to the Waste, Nakomi questions it. She then makes great food.. remarkably fast and very delicious.. interesting. Nakomi leaves and disappeares as do her belongings, after a search. Aviendha goes to sleep feeling troubled. On second thought, could this be Mogi? No.. I don't know - this person knows a lot about Aiel culture.</p>

<h2>Ch 40, A Making, Puzzle</h2>
<p><strong>Perrin.</strong> Well dang, that was incredible. Perrin forged a new hammer, Mah'alleinir (old tongue for "He who soars"), with a symbol of Hopper leaping on the side. It's huge and heavy and awesome. The Asha'man and Wise Ones formed a Circle and helped heat the metal with the One Power and did something to the Mah'alleinir, I'm interested to learn what they did. Perrin then tells everyone he will lead and gets the one Wolfhead Banner and they plan to ambush the Whitecloaks. Here we go! </p>

<p><strong>Faile.</strong> A POWER-WROUGHT WEAPON... DAAAAANG! YES! So Perrin will need Neald to forge Power-Wrought weapons? I can get behind that. Also, boo, let Perrin ambush the Whitecloaks!</p>

<p><strong>Perrin.</strong> Long Tooth! That was Elyas' wolf name. Also, "Perrin Goldeneyes has some killing to do tonight". LET'S GO!</p>

<p>Turns out.. There is an army of Trollocs and Myrddraal that Perrin was sensing.. and they have Dreadlords... here we go! Perrin raises him hammer and they attack the Shadowspawn, also Byar thinks Galad is the end of the Whitecloaks and Galad thinks that Perrin's crew are attacking - turns out they're there to save them! </p>

<h2>Ch 41, An Unexpected Ally, Whitecloak</h2>
<p><strong>Galad.</strong> Galad is wary of Perrin.. Byar thinks it's Perrin sending the Trollocs. </p>

<p><strong>Perrin.</strong> PORTAL STONES! I was just thinking about those and that we haven't used them very much lately, not much use now with Traveling. But, Perrin understood the plan - someone channeling is bringing Trollocs with a Portal Stone and Perrin then says he won't abandon the Whitecloaks the way they abandoned the Two Rivers. Perrin raises Ma'alleinir and joins the attack!</p>

<p><strong>Galad.</strong> Well that was pretty sad. Galad's horse, Stout, died and Galad hurt his ankle. Galad is worried about his men, because they've never fought Trollocs before. They have no special support of the Light, they're just men... deep.</p>

<p><strong>Perrin.</strong> So Perrins hammer burns the Trollocs.. that is AWESOME. The Whitecloaks aren't looking hot, so Perrin signals the AM, WOs, and AS to being their assault. Perrin then leads the charge downhill to rescue the Whitecloaks. Perrin is such a good guy.</p>

<p><strong>Galad.</strong> Galad and Perrin = friends. Byar = dead. Perrin = fond of his horse, Stepper. Galad names Perrin's punishment, a blood price of 500 crowns, and a promise to fight in the Last Battle with all his might. Bornhold kills Byar as Byar was trying to kill Perrin. Bornhold still doesn't like Perrin. Perrin let's Galad ride Stepper and they were to kill the Trollocs.</p>

<h2>Ch 42, Stronger than Blood, Heron</h2>
<p><strong>Gawyn.</strong> Danelle was Mesaana.. neat. Bunch more dead. Gawyn's messenger, dead. Gawyn wants to get married. Egwene needs to meet with the Hall. Something must be done with the SC. Gawyn then takes the ter'angreal rings from the assassins bodies and puts them in his pocket..... whyyyyyy?????</p>

<p><strong>Lan.</strong> GOOSEBUMPS! Lan says.. "The Golden Crane flies for Tarmon Gai'don", a call grows to a cheer, then a roar!!! There are thousands camped near Lan and more and more are coming to him. Lan also feels Nynaeve's bond.. love it! Lan is aware that Nynaeve now holds his bond. Her passion and kindness are remarkable. He has reached the Silverwall Keeps, a fortification at the border between Kandor and Arafel on the Firchon Pass protecting the westward access to Shol Arbela. Yakobin the Undaunted held keeps when Trollocs invaded deep into Arafel. There are thousands camped there, obviously waiting for Lan. He is furious that someone sent word ahead, but Andere replies that it is the obvious place that Lan would have to pass. He insists that they still pretend to be a caravan and they proceed through the pass. Rakim keeps reminding him, death is lighter than a feather, duty heavier than a mountain. The men all wear hadori and the women ki'sain. It would have made Bukama cry. </p>

<p>They pass through the gates and Lan says they are on their way to Fal Moran with supplies for Shienar for the Last Battle. They almost make their way through unnoticed but a young man in a window shouts recognition. He is Kaisel Noramaga, grandson of Queen Ethenielle of Kandor. Kendral, grandson of King Paitar of Arafel is there, too. They both insist on joining Lan and his army. Lan asks how he was recognized. Kaisel replies that Nynaeve told them about Mandarb. Lan thinks curses, and blessings, for her. He surrenders and says, "The Golden Crane flies for Tarmon Gai'don." A call grows to a cheer, then a roar.</p>

<h2>Ch 43, Some Tea, Bird</h2>
<p><strong>Galad.</strong> So Perrin needed Galad, ta'veren. Also, Galad has taken Healing from an AS. And Perrin offers a gateway for Galad and his men. Perrin and Galad agree that Perrin will command them until after the Last Battle. Perrin is very honest, Galad likes that.</p>

<p><strong>Alliandre.</strong> haha, this is great.. Berelain and Galad sitting in a tree lol. Berelain doesn't like being wrong about me, and she is talking with Alliandre about Mayene and then goes completely smitten for Galad hahahahah. Alliandre is a weird one lol. I think that was our first Alliandre perspective, she's a funny one.</p>

<p><em>Famous line to remember: "It's just a weave, Egwene."</em></p>

<h2>Ch 44, A Backhanded Request, Puzzle</h2>
<p><strong>Morgase.</strong> Aw, Tallanvor finally asks Morgase to marry her, and she accepts - they're on their way to see Perrin. They're also going to be going to Caemlyn to aid Elayne! WOO! I'm happy when people are happy. </p>

<p><strong>Perrin.</strong> MAT! Also, Perrin marries Tallanvor and Morgase, Galad has a letter with a red seal in his pocket.. Perrin has 70,000 in his retinue trained under Dannil and Tam. Neald can't remember what he did to create Mah'alleinir but he can make weapons that don't dull - the Aiel want more. Perrin has sent a messenger to Elayne requesting an audience. Trees are gone and dead, and dry overnight.. Perrin wants to have them harvested for firewood.</p>

<p>Mat shows up, he caught another badger.. haha EOTW. No swirling colors when they are together. Perrin asks about Thom, Nynaeve, and Mat interrupts him to warn him about assassins. He tells Perrin to meet him at The Happy Throng and asks to borrow an Asha'man for a gateway - while returning through a gateway.. to Caemlyn. Perrin chuckles as he tries to ease the poor badger.</p>

<h2>Ch 45, A Reunion, Lion</h2>
<p><strong>Elayne.</strong> That was a beautiful reunion between Elayne, Galad, and Morgase! OH OH could Morgase take rule of Cairhrien?? That'd be neat.</p>

<p>Elayne got confirmation from Egwene about Mesaana, and Gawyn. Melfane (midwife) hears twin heartbeats, woo. Chesmal's threat of invasion might be a threat of Trollocs in the Borderlands instead of Andor - I'm on the fence, but I trust Birgitte in fortifying Andor's borders.</p>

<p>Galad and Morgase show up, Galad says he is now LCC of the WC. Morgase is proud of Elayne. Elayne insists on having a celebration for her return, but agrees that it would be best to find a station for Morgase away from Caemlyn. Morgase tells Elayne about Perrin and wants to find a peaceful resolution with him. Morgase also says that Lini is safe then begins to tell her tale.</p>

<p><strong>Aviendha.</strong> Well, I am excited for Aviendha. She will enter the glass columns tomorrow and she hopes that she will get answers.</p>

<p>Aviendha looks down on the city of Rhuidean. Rand changed the city in three ways. The fog is gone, there is now water, and, most important, the city may not matter anymore. Why should Aiel leaders continue to learn of their past and their toh if they are finally meeting that toh? She is still troubled about her meeting with Nakomi and the almost-memories of her future from her first trip here. The lake beside the city is called Tsodrelle'Aman. Tears of the Dragon. The Aiel cannot return to the Three-fold Land yet. They must deal with the Last Battle, the Seanchan and the White Tower first. She knows her own future is with Rand. She will enter the glass columns tomorrow and she hopes that she will get answers.</p>

<h2>Ch 46, Working Leather, Dragon's Fang</h2>
<p><strong>Androl.</strong> Well this was really cool to see. Androl is a Dedicated at the Black Tower. There are some things happening at the Black Tower, and yes. Rand is busy, but it’d be good for Rand to stop by and check out what’s going on lol. Also, Logain is with Rand y’all.</p>

<p>Androl skillfully crafts a leather armguard. He is missing his shears and Cuellar is sharpening his belt knife so he weaves a mini-gateway to trim the leather. He is very weak in the One Power but he is the best there is at Traveling. Logain promoted him to Dedicated personally against Taim's wishes.</p>

<p>Logain left in the night weeks ago taking Donalo, Mezar and Welyn with him. And now there are two groups of Aes Sedai, one in the Black Tower grounds and one camped outside. The shadows start creeping toward him so he releases saidin. Oh man, he’s going mad! </p>

<p>He comes to the practice field and sees Dedicated divided into two groups, Canler, Emarin, Arlen Nalaam and Jonneth Dowtry in one and Taim's cronies including Coteren in another. Jonneth Dowtry's whole family including his grandfather Buel came with him. Emarin is a nobleman who arrived one day with Logain.</p>

<p>Androl has traveled widely, even to a Sea Folk island Retash. Androl gives the armguard to Jonneth Dowtry who gives a brief demonstration of the Two Rivers longbow. Coteren belittles them and Androl has to calm the others so they do not get into serious trouble. Nalaam talks gibberish, his symptom of madness.</p>

<p>Androl is worried that more and more men are taking personal lessons with the M'Hael. Nensen and Kash became strong very fast and were rapidly promoted to full Asha'man. Canler says that Norley, Evin, Hardlin and the Two Rivers men are trustworthy but not a one is full Asha'man. Androl is also worried about the Aes Sedai bonding them. Full Asha'man, all of Taim's cronies, are exempt. They are also spreading rumors that Rand has abandoned them. Emarin says Rand is not mad. He met Rand just before he came to the Black Tower.</p>

<p>They plan to gather information against Taim for Logain when he returns. They look to Androl as their leader.</p>

<h2>Ch 47, A Teaching Chamber, A'dam</h2>
<p><strong>Faile.</strong> Well that was all over the place lol. But... also, Grady tried to make a gateway to the Black Tower and it didn't work - so not a dreamspike. Something else must be blocking entrance... but what?! </p>

<p>Faile, Perrin, Alliandre and Elayne join Morgase in a sitting room. The negotiations are testy at first and Morgase speaks in favor of Perrin, also warning Elayne that he is ta'veren. In fighting Perrin she is fighting the Pattern itself. They ultimately agree that Elayne will give the Two Rivers to the Dragon Reborn. Perrin will be his steward and High Lord. That will form a bond with Ghealdan and also give Andor leverage against a pact between Tear and Illian.</p>

<p>With that settled, the conversation becomes less formal and friendlier. Elayne tells them that Egwene is now Amyrlin and that Rand has upset her. He plans to break the remaining seals. Elayne thinks it is a foolish plan. Perrin says he can be of help. Testing Elayne's information, Faile asks where Rand is. She replies that she does not know right now, but she does know where he will be.</p>

<p><strong>Fortuona.</strong> OH SHOOT! Also, very blatantly confirmed.. the Seanchan have Traveling now. Also, also... Suffa is Elaida! WOW, that was crazy. I'm happy we aren't worried about this "weapon" anymore, also, no one seems to be doing much unraveling of weaves lately? Hmm. The White Tower is going to be attacked AGAIN?! Yikes, Egwene can't catch a break! </p>

<p>Through Selucia, Fortuona asks how Galgan would use Traveling. He replies that he will need to question Suffa to learn more about it and Fortuona concurs. Speaking directly to Beslan, she states that there are still hundreds of marath'damane in the White Tower. They are the key to recapturing Seanchan, to holding this land and to prepare for the Last Battle. The Dragon Reborn must serve the Crystal Throne. Galgan will bring every damane back to Ebou Dar and train them in Traveling. As Truthspeaker, Selucia warns Fortuona that this must be kept secret. They must strike soon and destroy the White Tower.</p>

<p><strong>Perrin.</strong> Oh I love this so much. Mat, Thom, and Perrin talking in The Happy Throng! Sharing stories, and reminiscing. They haven't seen Verin for two weeks.. RIP. They discuss avoiding assassins with gateways. And, Mat needs a gateway to visit this tower, and it's like they're ta'veren or something and Perrin says the Tower of Ghenjei! They're going to rescue Moiraine.. and Mat tells the whole story. </p>

<p>Also, CAMEO! Dragonmount's, Jason Denzel!!</p>

<h2>Ch 48, Near Avendesora, Aiel</h2>
<p><strong>Aviendha.</strong> Whoa dang, I wasn't expecting that.. yes! Here we freaking goooooooo! CRAZY.. IT IS THE FUTURE OF THE AIEL?!?!?! WHOAAAAA!</p>

<p>Aviendha was walking out of her trip through the glass columns of Rhuidean - seeing Avendesora regrown from when it burned! She then tries to Read the columns with her newfound Talent of reading ter'angreal. It is too vast to comrepehnd! Then.. boom - glass columns trip..</p>

<p>She is Malidra, eighteen years old, scavenging for food at the camp of the Lightmakers. They ride in a large wagon on wheels with no horses. Jorshem told her they are building a road on pieces of metal. There are two Lightmakers by the wagon. They have dark hair. She digs through trash but a light shines on her. One of the men, Flern, points a rod at her and something hits her in the back. The last thing she hears is, "Bloody Aiel."</p>

<p>HOLY CRAP. Seanchan... sheeeesh. and Garlvan, the baby was no longer breathing.. oh my gosh.</p>

<p>She is Norlesh with her baby Garlvan and daughter Meise. Her husband Metalan talks with the outlanders about food. These outlanders seem to be ordinary folk, not Illuminated Ones. Metalan wants to trade for food but the outlanders say that the Raven Empress forbids it. They have not had a home since the time of her greatmother Tava. As they hide for the night she notices that Garlvan is not breathing. She can hardly feel sorrow.</p>

<p>Aviendha cannot believe these people were her ancestors. She has no choice but to step forward.</p>

<p>She is Tava, fourteen years old. Her hold is under attack by strange flying beasts with men who fire arrows and weapons of fire. A Stone Dog Tadvishm falls before her; Anyone trying to fight dies immediately. Her father Rowahn attacks one of the riders and manages to kill him, taking his sword. The attack is over. He orders them to put out the fires and begin rebuilding, but some of the men start to leave. Whenever they gather they are attacked. The Raven Empire send word to the Far Ones  to attack from the east as well. They are a clan no longer. </p>

<p>In horror, Aviendha realizes the attackers were Seanchan soldiers on raken. This is not the past; it is the future of the Aiel. She takes another step. </p>

<h2>Ch 49, Court of the Sun, Aiel</h2>
<p><strong>Aviendha.</strong> Well heck dude, this was beautiful. Powerful and exciting. I love the childrens names.. Janduin, after Rand's own dad! And now, Aviendha is exhausted. She now remembers her children from the three rings but she did not remember these visions. There has to be a way for her to change the future. She reenters the glass columns but they are now dead. She must figure out a way to save her people. She will return to the Wise Ones but first she must remain in the Three-fold Land to think.</p>

<p>She is Ladalin, Wise One of the Taardad Aiel. She and Mora of the Goshien Aiel are the only ones with the three clan chiefs. Her mother spoke of gai'shain but now all Aiel fight the Seanchan. She is very old now and her first memories were the Almoth strikes. She fought at Tear. Tamaav arrives with news that the White Tower has fallen. Takai is clan chief of the Miagoma. Jorshem is another chief. </p>

<p>The Seanchan have taken Rhuidean, Illian and Cairhien. All of the lands west of the mountains have fallen and the Seanchan have the Andoran war machines. The Daryne and Shiande are no more; only five clans remain, one scattered. They must retreat back to the Three-fold Land. The Dragon wanted peace but the Aiel could not accept that with the Seanchan. This was the worst vision for Aviendha as she felt some sense of Aiel in Ladalin. But they have no honor. They fight just for the sake of fighting and hatred. She steps forward.</p>

<p>She is Oncala, a Maiden of the Spear. She carries the blood of the Dragon Reborn and is held in high esteem. She plans to marry Hehyal, of the Dawn Runners and clan chief of the Taardad. All of the nations still keep the peace of the Dragon except for the Aiel who have been fighting the Seanchan for forty years. She and Hehyal have come to Caemlyn and Queen Talana to convince her to fight the Seanchan as well. They show her plans stolen from the Ebou Dar palace that outline an attack on Caemlyn. Talana will think on it. Afterwards, Hehyal is uncomfortable that they did not tell the whole truth, that the plans are only a contingency but Oncala is satisfied. With Andor's power, other nations in the Pact of the Griffin and the Court of the Sun will join the war. They will defeat the Raven Empire and she will rule the Dragon Empire.</p>

<p>Aviendha can barely go on. That power-hungry, honorless creature was her own granddaughter. She steps forward.</p>

<p>She is Padra, daughter of the Dragon Reborn and a Maiden. She and her three siblings, brothers Alarch and Janduin and sister Marinna, hold the One Power constantly and channeled since early childhood. Alarch has his looks from his wetlander side and has dark hair. She and her spear sisters attacked a Seanchan patrol that got too close to the Aiel camp and Tarra died in the skirmish. It is seventeen years since the Last Battle and their camp in Arad Doman has been in the same place for a decade. She reports to Ronam, son of Rhuarc and now clan chief of the Taardad. There is a meeting of clan chiefs, Tavalad of the Goshien, Alalved of the Tomanelle, Darvin of the Reyn, Bruan of the Nakai, Shedren of the Daryne. Padra says the Dragon's Peace does not apply to the Aiel and they will attack any Seanchan who come too close to their camp. They have been in one place too long. It is time to make war on the Seanchan for collaring Wise Ones. The clan chiefs agree and all leave except Padra and Ronam. He is ten years older and remembers Rand from Cold Rocks Hold. Rhuarc told him that Rand was clever and a great leader, but he did not know what to do with the Aiel. He planned for the other nations but left the Aiel to drift. War is all they know and it will bring honor.</p>

<h2>Ch 50, Choosing Enemies, Rising Sun</h2>
<p><strong>Elayne.</strong> Boo.. bored. Elayne striped Arymilla, Elenia, and Naean of their titles and estates and are giving them to Cairhienin nobility.. Bertome Saighan (cousin of Colavaere) and Lorstrum Aesnan. There are also Ailil Riatin, Lord and Lady Osiellin, Lord and Lady Chuliandred, Lord and Lady Hamarashle and Lord Mavabwin. Elayne will make some the nobles stewards over the lands she just took by forfeit. She then offers Elenia a chance for a new start. There would be lands available if there is unification between Andor and Cairhien. She tells the Cairhienin that she will need authority to close such a deal and they eagerly offer to make arrangements.</p>

<p>After the others have left Birgitte expresses her confusion. Dyelin and Morgase sit beside Elayne. Morgase pours Tremalking black tea. They explain that Elayne captured the favor of Bertome and Lorstrum by setting up an opportunity for one of them to eventually take both thrones. They are the most powerful in Cairhien since Dobraine has not returned. She has chosen her enemies and knows who to watch out for. They will plot against her but it will be many years before they can safely move. They wait for the Cairhienin nobles to return via gateway to close the deal.</p>

<h2>Ch 51, A Testing, Dragon</h2>
<p><strong>Min.</strong> Quite the gamble these people had lol. Also I love asking Cadsuane to call him Rand Sedai because he was the only alive male Aes Sedai raised to not fall to the Shadow.. awesome! I'm confused why the boys can't Travel to the BT! Min holds Callandor, that's scary lol, but then again all this is scary lol. Min views, Callandor being gripped in a black hand (onyx).</p>

<p>Then Ethenielle and a man with a sheathed sword walk up to Rand. She slaps him hard. One by one the others follow drawing blood. Rand is angry but holds his temper and quiets those with him. Paitar then asks how Tellindal Tirraso died. Upset, Rand replies that she was a clerk who died accidentally in the fighting when Demandred attacked him. They finally acknowledge him as the Dragon Reborn.</p>

<p>Rand takes the sword and puts it in a sheath over his back. He also wears the sword he acquired in Arad Doman. They represent the future and the past to him. Min fears Callandor. She thinks it has a deeper flaw than they know of and that it will be used against Rand. He orders Narishma to open a gateway to Far Madding so they can pay an overdue call on the Borderlanders there. Rand asks Naeff if there is any word from the Black Tower and Naeff says no. Rand says he cannot Travel there and fears the worst. He shows Naeff how to weave a disguise and tells him to Travel to nearby the Black Tower and ride in. Find Logain and those loyal to him and deliver a message. Tell them that they are not weapons, they are men.</p>

<p>He tells Cadsuane to be prepared to make a gateway for retreat if necessary. She says she cannot touch the True Source there but he notes that she is wearing a full paralis-net which includes a Well. Rand says he wore the original male version. When she calls him "boy" one more time he suggests that she call him Rand Sedai. They walk through the gateway where Maiden scouts wait with horses and ride to Far Madding. Rand rides Tai'daishar. Rand says the city is even more ancient than the guardian, Aren Deshar, Aren Mador, Far Madding. The enclave of the Incastar were afraid of progress. Gilgame has all of Lews Therin's memories but he tells Min there is a big difference. He has Min, Tam, Perrin, Nynaeve, Mat, Aviendha, Elayne, Moiraine. Min wonders if the rest of the Borderlands are suffering like Maradon did. </p>

<p>An escort meets them and brings them to the front of the army where they meet Ethenielle, Paitar, Easar and Tenobia. Min has viewings of them: Tenobia - a spear hovering over her head, bloody, but shining in the light. Ethenielle - white doves meaning that she will soon be wed. Easar and Paitar - Swords, shields and arrows, they will fight soon.</p>

<p>Ethenielle and a man with a sheathed sword  walk up to Rand. She slaps him hard. One by one the others follow drawing blood. Rand is angry but holds his temper and quiets those with him. Paitar then asks how Tellindal Tirraso died. Upset, Rand replies that she was a clerk who died accidentally in the fighting when Demandred attacked him. They finally acknowledge him as the Dragon Reborn.</p>

<p><strong>Cadsuane.</strong> I mean, just awesome....</p>

<p>They sit in a large tent with the rulers. Thirteen Aes Sedai wait outside but they do not seem to bother Rand. Cadsuane knows some of them. Paitar says his ancestor Reo Myershi heard a Foretelling from an Aes Sedai: I see him before you. Him, the one who lives many lives, the one who gives deaths, the one who raises mountains. He will break what he must break, but first he stands here, before our king. You will bloody him! Measure his restraint. He speaks! How was the fallen slain? Tellindal Tirraso, murdered by his hand, the darkness that came the day after the light. You must ask, and you must know your fate. If he cannot answer then you will be lost. You will bring his end swiftly, so that the final days may have their storm. So that Light may not be consumed by he who was to have preserved it. I see him. And I weep.</p>

<p>Rand tells them they came close to doom. A short time earlier he would have returned the slaps with balefire. He says the guardian only blocks the One Power, which greatly puzzles Cadsuane. He says he will teach their Aes Sedai gateways if they will swear to him. He will meet the monarchs of the world tomorrow then go to Shayol Ghul to break the remaining seals. The Borderlanders can come with him to the Last Battle only if they swear to him. He will wait one hour for their answer. Meantime he asks them to send for Hurin so he can apologize. One more day and it will all begin. Cadsuane hopes that they are ready.</p>

<h2>Ch 52, Boots, Sun</h2>
<p><strong>Elayne.</strong> Now that's what I'm talking about.. Birgitte plopping herself down on the Sun Throne saying "you'd think it'd be more comfortable" hahahah.. so Elayne has Cairhien now - thanks to Rand. Elayne and Birgitte also have both copies of the foxhead medallion - Elayne has been having limited success making copies now that Mat has it back. Someone tried to assassinate Elayne with a poisoned needle. The coroniation feast is planned, but Elayne says they need to gather forces to march with Andor via gateways to the Field of Merrilor and the Last Battle! </p>

<p><strong>Mat.</strong> What could that letter say? Maybe something about Verin being Black Ajah.. maybe. I love Mat's talk with Satelle, he's so good.</p>

<p>Setalle joins him. She got a letter from Joline; they arrived safely at the White Tower. They talk briefly about Aes Sedai and what Setalle lost. They also talk about what Mat dislikes about nobles. It is about the boots. An average person only has two or three pair and they wear their best for walking. On the other hand, Talmanes has forty pairs. Lopin complained that Mat did not have more. They are used for show rather than utility. Setalle will see to Olver until Mat, Thom and Noal return then he we see her returned to Ebou Dar. Mat is worried about Birgitte's advice on the Tower. Even she could not defeat the Aelfinn and Eelfinn, but Mat has his luck. A Redarm, Clintock checks in to make sure he is okay. Mat gets up and leaves Verin's letter on his desk. They leave for the Tower of Ghenjei tomorrow.</p>

<h2>Ch 53, Gateways, Wheel</h2>
<p><strong>Pervara.</strong> So that's interesting, something - almost like a dreamspike - is hindering gateways. I can't wait to find out! </p>

<p>Pevara is walking through the BT with Javindhra and Taim. Taim still refuses to let them bond full Asha'man. He says they must ask permission to leave. Pevara wants to leave, Javindhra wants to study. Tarna wants to stay too, but Tarna is looking insane. The Highest forbade gateways unless the situation becomes dire.. but gateways can't be formed. They are trapped. WHAT IS GOING ON HERE?!</p> 

<p><strong>Perrin.</strong> Oh yes, this is going to be awesome. Perrin sends Mat, Thom, and Noal to rescue Moiraine - they will meet again at Master Denezel's place. Grady opened the gateway and he will open a gateway the same place, everyday at noon. Perrin's leg still throbs from Slayer's arrow even though he was Healed. Also, I just want to say.. I'm on Rand's side, and Perrin's side - break the seals. Let's freaking do this. </p>

<p>Soon, Grady and Neald link with the Aes Sedai and Edarra and open a large gateway to the Field of Merrilor. There are many armies already there, Tear, Illian, Cairhienin, but no Borderlanders yet. Faile thinks Perrin agreed with Elayne to help stop Rand, but Perrin says he trusts Rand and breaking the seals seems right to him. He orders Aravine to set up camp away from the other armies. Sulin and Gaul can pick the site. He is puzzled why Aravine did not return to Amadicia as she is clearly a noble. Berelain rides next to Galad as the Whitecloaks ride through the gateway. Gallenne and the Winged Guard ride near them. Alliandre, Arganda and the Ghealdanin ride through next. Perrin has sent to Mayene and Jehannah for more soldiers and Tam is gathering more from the Two Rivers. Azi al'Thone and Jori Congar carry the wolf banner as Two Rivers men ride by. Jori apologizes for spreading rumors about Perrin and Berelain. As he steps through the gateway, Perrin hopes that Rand comes quickly. He can feel it starting.</p>

<p><strong>Mat.</strong> Prediction.. they save Moiraine. </p>

<p>Well DANG THIS IS AWESOME! Ahh, this is so good. Also, Noal has to be Jain Farstrider.. gotta be, wearing strange clothes Mat doesn't understand.. gotta be! Mat has his ashandarei with an iron counterweight. With a bronze knife, Thom draws a small triangle with a wavy line through it and the steel in the triangle vanishes. It is way too small so he repeats the move making a large opening.</p>

<p>They step through with a blinding flash of light and are in a room with four openings. The doorway is freestanding in the middle of the room. They walk down a hallway and through a window Mat can see that he is in one of the spires that he saw on his earlier trips. At the end of the hallway they find another similar room. They retrace their path and find they are in a different room. There is no way to map their route. Mat asks Thom if he ever heard a story of someone in the Tower and he replies that Elmiara spent a hundred days in the land of the Shadoweyes hunting the spring of Sund to heal her lover, very much what Birgitte told Mat.</p>

<p>Suddenly one of the Eelfinn confronts them saying they have broken the bargain. It tries to trick them, speaking of the Chamber of Bonds, but Thom's music puts it to sleep. Noal compliments Mat on his mastery of the Old Tongue. Mat begins selecting passages by random rolls of his dice and they soon find themselves in a large room with fluted black columns. It is familiar to Mat. They are on the right track.</p>

<h2>Ch 54, The Light of the World, Snakes and Foxes</h2>
<p><strong>Mat.</strong> Half the light of the world.. Mat's left eye, to save the world.. Moiraine. That's a good bargain, right? Whoa! It did seem to be too easy... the snakes are coming the snakes are coming! ALSO, MOIRAINE IS BACK!!!!!</p>

<p>The melted remains of the twisted red doorway are in the middle of the room. They hear sounds and are quickly surrounded by Eelfinn. Mat's ashandarei blade seems to pass through them, but Thom's iron knife and the iron band on Mat's spear strike home. Mat throws one of Aludra's nightflowers and when it explodes he picks a random direction to lead Thom and Noal. They follow a corridor and suddenly are in front of a carved wooden doorway.</p>

<p>They enter and it is the same room Mat remembers with eight pedestals. Except that Moiraine floats in the center. She wears only the ivory bracelet. He reaches forward but his hands burn. Thom then reaches for her, ignoring the pain, and pulls her free. The pedestals are suddenly occupied with Eelfinn. Here they will make a bargain and set a price. Mat demands that they be given a clear path back to the way out without the Eelfinn interfering. They reply that this will be expensive. Another says that the price has been set. Knowing exactly what he means, Mat agrees. The Eelfinn leap on him and one of them rips out his left eye. They all collapse in ecstasy as Mat howls in pain. They leave, Thom carrying Moiraine, and run down the hallway. They pass through the room with the melted twisted red doorway and down another hall, but they hear sounds. Mat's demand included no interference from the Eelfinn but he did not mention the Aelfinn. They see sinuous figures in front of them with bronze swords and they run.</p>

<h2>Ch 55, The One Left Behind, Snakes and Foxes</h2>
<p><strong>Mat.</strong> Yes! They made it out, with Moiraine alive.. sadly Noal / Jain Farstrider died clean.. ah man. Mat remembered one way, that took him to wear the first doorway he went through, but it was broken into pieces. I KNEW NOAL WAS JAIN! I KNEW IT!</p>

<p>No way out. Mat thinks furiously on how he got out last time. Thinking back, he asked for his memories filled, escape from Aes Sedai and to get out. His memory of battles fulfilled the first and the foxhead medallion the second. He never asked for the ashandarei. He assumed it was a weapon, but it is something else. He plunges it into the nearest wall and a burst of light comes through. The brilliance drives back the Aelfinn. He cuts the triangle and wavy line figure and a section of the wall falls away. Thom leaps through with Moiraine. After a final curse for the Aelfinn and Eelfinn and a tip of his hat Mat follows. There is a flash of white.</p>

<h2>Ch 56, Something Wrong, Dragon's Fang</h2>
<p><strong>Egwene.</strong> "He's here"... the clouds part and the blue sky appears... that is so cool! Gawyn is so happy Morgase is alive. There is a new force of farmers here at the Field of Merrilor. THERE ARE SO MANY PEOPLE HERE. Elayne and crew arrive as well. Perrin's crew too, the Band too.</p>

<p><strong>Androl.</strong> I still don't know what's going on with the gateway weaves.. but my guess is it's a dreamspike - and since none of these people are in TAR (I guess I'm just stuck on the fatigue that Perrin was getting when he entered the dreamspike), but if no one is in TAR - then it has to be a dreamspike... so, it's a dreamspike from Graendal, there I said it. lol. Mezar (full Asha'man that Taim raised) doesn't seem quite alive.. I'm guessing some sort of Compulsion but I really am not sure. And then Androl enters Pevara's room.. he wants to work together. She says come in quickly befroe Tarna returns. </p>

<p>Yeah, so it's gotta be a dreamspike inside the black tower.. that's what it is - why was I so stuck.. idk. </p>

<h2>Ch 57, A Rabbit for Supper, Dice</h2>
<p><strong>Mat.</strong> Oh I'm happy, this was so good. Moiraine is safe, Mat is awesome, and Thom is going to be married and Warder to Moiraine! I LOVE IT! I also love the "it was there if you looked closely", that sure sounds like Robert Jordan lol. Mat is worried how he will be able to fight with only one eye, but his luck has him taken care of it seems. SO GOOD. </p>

<p>They are back outside the Tower of Ghenjei; he feared it might be Rhuidean. He does a victory dance then joins Thom and Moiraine. They move near the Arinelle River where they use Aludra's strikers to start a small fire. Moiraine tells some of her story. The Aelfinn and Eelfinn feed on emotion like a drug. She can still channel but she is now very weak in the One Power from their draining. They told her they killed Lanfear that way. A man came one time, but said she was not the one he wanted. She still has the ivory bracelet angreal, one of her three demands. She offers to Heal Mat's pain but he refuses. Moiraine says she must find Rand and asks after him. Mat sees him eating with Min. Mat says that the taint is cleansed, per Verin. Moiraine smiles, "By the Dragon came our pain, and by the Dragon was the wound repaired." </p>

<p>Mat tells her Elayne is Queen. Thom tells her that Mat married the Empress of Seanchan. Moiraine repeats that she needs to find Rand and Mat says he is going back to Caemlyn. Maybe Elayne can help. Mat is stunned when Thom and Moiraine express love for each other and agree to marry. He will also be her Warder. She hopes the right person has her previous Warder by now.</p>


<h2>Epilogue, And After, Wheel</h2>
<p><strong>Graendal.</strong> OHHH, maybe Byar was a Darkfriend with Graendal.. hmm. Also yes, Isam /  Luc / Slayer. She plans to use a Portal Stone. Shaidar Haran appears and blames her for the deaths of three Chosen, including Mesaana. The dreamspike trapped her in the WT. Graendal's opportunity to hurt Trand has been given to another.. whoooooo? She dying here? No, probably not.</p> 

<p><strong>Perrin.</strong> So, Boundless was Noam, is Noam. Neat! He didn't lost himself, he chose to become a wolf - he chose his balance as Elyas has and as Perrin can. Perrin sends thank yous to all the wolves. Alright, I can get behind that. Things are wrapping up nicely here. </p>

<p><em>Undulate count: 7</em></p>

<p><strong>Olver.</strong> Do we call that ta'veren? The Olver opened the letter for Mat? lol. Olver also won the game of snakes and foxes and he thinks he is going to go to the Tower of Ghenjei himself... I'm not optomistic. Olver opens Verin's letter and Shadowspawn are coming into a Waygate into Caemlyn - it's time to fight. </p>

<p>Does that mean all the Waygates aren't blocked? like Loial was doing? Or he was just having them guarded right? So, maybe Shadowspawn are going to come from EVERYWHERE! Also, I'm not optomistic for Olver's survival either.. or Talmanes... yikes. </p>

<p><strong>Barriga.</strong> Hmm, who dresses like Aiel but their veils are red.. I can't think of anyone right now - but I can wager they aren't killing these people for the Light...</p>

<p><strong>Rand.</strong> Oh boy, are we about to get Rand falling in love with Lanfear?! Also, Rand is dreaming a normal dream, he is in the Mountains of Mist about the valley where he began his journey - is this where he was in The Dragon Reborn?? His body is asleep at the Field of Merrilor. Tomorrow he plans to make his demands to Egwene and crew. He hears a scream, dark corridor, it's Mierin Eronaile, Lanfear. She begs him to help her escape from the tortue but the wall falls away and she tumbles into darkness. </p>

<p>So, is Rand going to save Lanfear from Ishamael? Well, maybe, I really don't have an answer for that... wow. </p>

<p><strong>Lan.</strong> Yes, yes, yes! Lan's army of 12,000 approach Tarwin's Gap. Lan claims his rightful title, Lord of the Seven Towers, Defender of the Wall of First Fires, Bearer of the Sword of the Thousand Lakes. They charge toward 150,000 Shadowspawn. They will meet their end with swords raised. YES YES YES! </p>


<h2>Footer</h2>
<p>"Lo, it shall come upon the world that the prison of the Greatest One
shall grow weak, like the limbs of those who crafted it. Once again, His
glorious cloak shall smother the Pattern of all things, and the Great
Lord shall stretch forth His hand to claim what is His. The rebellious
nations shall be laid barren, their children caused to weep. There shall
be none but Him, and those who have turned their eyes to His majesty.
In that day, when the One-Eyed Fool travels the halls of mourning, and
the First Among Vermin lifts his hand to bring freedom to Him who
will Destroy, the last days of the Fallen Blacksmith's pride shall come.
Yea, and the Broken Wolf, the one whom Death has known, shall fall and
be consumed by the Midnight Towers. And his destruction shall bring
fear and sorrow to the hearts of men, and shall shake their very will itself.
And then shall the Lord of the Evening come. And He shall take our
eyes, for our souls shall bow before Him, and he shall take our skin, for
our flesh shall serve Him, and He shall take our lips, for only Him will
we praise. And the Lord of the Evening shall face the Broken Champion,
and shall spill his blood and bring us the Darkness so beautiful. Let the
screams begin, O followers of the Shadow. Beg for your destruction!
— From The Prophecies of the Shadow</p>
