    <h2>Ye, Dante Bowe, And So Many More</h2>
    <p>I'm not going to go into detail about the names mentioned, because I don't know the full story. I just know, there have been things said about these names and people are upset by what's been said.</p>

    <p>The world we live in now is a Cancel Culture. You do something wrong, and you are ousted by the world and are <em>cancelled</em>, and everyone talks about you and writes about you and you are pushed away and people hate you. That is not what Christ asks of us.</p>

    <p>The goal of this post is tell you my thoughts on Cancel Culture. You don't have to agree with me.</p>



    <h2>Forgiveness</h2>
    <p>As a Christian, we are asked to forgive others. But this is something that I've been struggling with lately. And I've come to a conclusion. And that comes from Ephesians 4:32.</p>

    <p>Be kind to one another, tender-hearted, forgiving each other, just as God in Christ also has forgiven you. <br><strong>Ephesians 4:32 NASB1995</strong>
    <br><a href="https://www.bible.com/bible/100/EPH.4.32.NASB1995" target="_blank">Bible App</a></p>

    <p>I was struggling because of the world we live in, do I <em>cancel</em> these people and ignore them for the rest of my life? Do I stop listening to their music? Do I stop watching their movies? Maybe.</p>

    <p>But, as Christians we are also asked to <strong>Turn Away from Evil</strong>.</p>



    <h2>Turn Away from Evil</h2>
    <p>There is also the consideration of Evil. And are these people evil? Are <em>we also</em> evil?</p>

    <p>A wise man is cautious and turns away from evil, But a fool is arrogant and careless.
    <br><strong>Proverbs 14:16 NASB1995</strong>
    <br><a href="https://www.bible.com/bible/100/pro.14.16" target="_blank">Bible App</a></p>

    <p>Again, do I <em>cancel</em> these people and ignore them for the rest of my life? Do I stop listening to their music? Do I stop watching their movies? Maybe.</p>



    <h2>Cancel is Not Compassion</h2>
    <p>I heard this from a friend and I took it to heart. In the Cancel-Culture World we live in today, we are not showing the love and compassion of Christ to others by cancelling them. We are ignoring them. I am going to try and forgive these people, and love them as Christ loves us.</p>


    <p>So let's try to show others compassion and forgiveness, instead of <em>cancelling</em> them.</p>
