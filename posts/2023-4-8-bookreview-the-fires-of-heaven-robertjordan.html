<h2>Spoilers</h2>
<p>Just a bit of preamble here.. the way this review will be is a lot of different from others. I'm wrote notes on every single chapter that I read. Which is completely spoiler, so this is where the spoilers start.. read at your own risk!</p>

<p>And now I'm adding in predictions for upcoming books and more! Check that out below.</p>

    <details id="spoilers">
        <summary>Spoilers</summary>
        <h2>Thoughts on FOH</h2>
        <p>Good grief. This was an awesome book. I'll need to reread my notes and think about my thoughts for each book to decide, but this was an EPIC ending. I am impressed with how everyone has leveled up FOR SURE. I really think Rand is going mad.. maybe. I really appreciate LTT inside of Rand's head. I also really love the shifting of Rand and LTT in the Caemlyn Royale Palace. That was cool to read, because Rand was fighting to be full. So much from Forsaken.. this was such a good boook.</p>

        <p>We got A LOT this book. Darkhounds, Forsaken, T'A'R', Lews Therin, Balefire, a CIRCUS! I loved this book.</p>

        <h2>Birgitte</h2>
        <p>I cannot believe we've got Birgitte in the waking world. AND ELAYNE HAS BONDED HER AS A WARDER?!</p>

        <h2>Nynaave</h2>
        <p>This was an amazing Nynaeve book. I was really glad to see what we saw from Nynaeve, with her Power and her ability to learn things and her wanting to be a Yellow (she really wants to Heal).</p>

        <h2>Elayne</h2>
        <p>I really liked Elayne this book. She is powerful and apparenlty she is going to do something with the a'dam.. I have no idea what's going on with that.</p>

        <h2>Thom</h2>
        <p>I'm glad Thom and Elayne are not going to try and be in a relationship. That was a little weird. I love the Thom / Gareth Bryne dynamic. Thom is always awesome.</p>

        <h2>The Circus</h2>
        <p>This was amazing and fun, I loved it.</p>

        <h2>Siuan</h2>
        <p>A deposded Siuan is not a weak Siuan.. SO GOOD.</p>

        <h2>Logain</h2>
        <p>Glory? Yet to be seen.</p>

        <h2>Rand, The Lord Dragon Reborn, Car'a'carn</h2>
        <p>Well, Rand, LTT, Rand is AWESOME. I am so excited to read more about Rand. I want to learn so much more about the Power and everything. THIS IS GREAT! Super powerful with the a'ngrael in his pocket, and getting really good about his use of the Power. Rand and Aviendha had sex. Whoa. That was pretty crazy when that happened.</p>

        <h2>Aviendha</h2>
        <p>I love Aviendha. I appreciate when she's actually telling Rand things - not when she's just brushing him off and being sort of rude to Rand for not knowing everything. But I look forward to Rand + Min + Elayne + Avienda. I'm also really interested in seeing what Elayne does when she finds out about the igloo.</p>

        <h2>Mat</h2>
        <p>I love Mat. He is so funny and awesome. I love that he is becoming this general and now has his own banner.. it was time he got his own.</p>

        <h2>Asmodean</h2>
        <p>I was so happy for Rand to have a teacher, and now I have no idea what Rand is going to do without Asmo!</p>

        <h2>Rahvin</h2>
        <p>Dead. I'm glad. I really hated what he was doing to Morgase - I'm really interested to know what happens with the Compulsion since Rahvin is dead.</p>
    </details>

    <details id="spoilers"  style="border-color: rgb(27, 105, 57);">
        <summary style="background-color: rgb(27, 105, 57);">Predictions and Theories</summary>
        <h2 style="font-style:italic;">Predictions</h2>
        <p>Let's see how I do, when I check back here after a few books.</p>

        <h2>Moiraine is not dead</h2>
        <p>Moiraine and Lanfear went to into the Twisted Doorway Ter'angreal and they are certainly not dead. I have no idea why or how Lan can feel the bond of this Green Sister (who's name I can't remember). But there is NO WAY MOIRAINE IS DEAD. No way.</p>

        <h2>Book Six, Lord of Chaos</h2>
        <p>I think this book will be the Perrin book, since we got NO PERRIN this book. At least that is my prediction, we'll see!</p>

        <h2>Nynaeve</h2>
        <p>Nynaeve will certainly figure out how to stop the block on her channeling. I feel like she's getting close to figuring that out. AND, I think Nynaeve is going to choose the Yellow Ajah.</p>

        <h2>Stilling and Gentling</h2>
        <p>I predict both of these will be able to be Healed! I have no idea how, but I believe they will be able to be Healed.</p>

        <br>
        <h2 style="font-style:italic;">Theories</h2>
        <p>I'm not one to theories besides asking silly questions.. let's see!</p>

        <h2>Rand and Lews Therin</h2>
        <p>I LOVE THIS. I just want to see more of this. That's it, I just want to see this more. There was a lot of talk about Ilyena during the Balefire fight with Ravhin.</p>

        <br>
        <h2 style="font-style:italic;">Questions</h2>
        <p>I have questions..</p>


        <h2>Warders</h2>
        <p>So anyone can be a wader? Elayne often talks about bonding Rand.. I haven't read anything that would say that couldn't be possible, but I'm just questioning that. What would happen if that happens?</p>

        <h2>Morgase's Compulsion</h2>
        <p>Since Rahvin is dead.. now what? Will she keep wanting to be in his love?</p>

        <h2>Saidin</h2>
        <p>Is there any worry now about going Mad with Saidin because of the Taint? Because Rand... well he's not great, but he's not completely mad yet. Unless we haven't fully seen that since the Prologue Dragonmount.</p>

        <br>
        <h2 style="font-style: italic;">Things to think about</h2>
        <p>I have some things to think about...</p>

        <h2>A'dam</h2>
        <p>I am glad to have read that when Nynaeve has Mogi linked when Nynaeve thinks she is channeling it's actually Mogi channeling.</p>

        <h2>Moghedien</h2>
        <p>I have no idea how Nynave and Moghedien will see each other in Salidar.. but I'm putting this here because I WANT TO KNOW WHAT IS GOING TO HAPPEN.</p>

        <h2>Elayne</h2>
        <p>I really liked Elayne this book. She is powerful and apparently she is going to do something with the a'dam.. I have no idea what's going on with that.</p>

        <summary style="background-color:rgb(27, 86, 105);">Notes As I Read</summary>

        <h2>Prologue - The First Sparks Fall</h2>
        <p>Back into the Wheel of Time... HERE WE GO! This Prologue was huge! Elaida as Amarylin.. this is incredible to see - I'm terrified to see what happens with Elaida. I'm really interested in these paintings that Elaida has on the wall. I'm also interested in learning about all the Blues not being there anymore. Is it true that really ALL THE BLUE AJAH are gone?</p>

        <p>Padan Fain MADE IT TO THE WHITE TOWER?! That was fast. Two months.. interesting.</p>

        <p>RHAVIN, Lanfear, Sammael, and Grandael.. THIS WAS AMAZING! I'm so excited to learn more about the Chosen and so much about their plans. This is facinating, really. I'm really glad to see the getting the information we've gotten so far of the Chosen. SO GOOD.</p>


        <h2>Fanning the Sparks</h2>
        <p>MIN - Oh this was nice! I'm really glad to be back with Min, Siuan, and Leane. THIS IS SO GOOD. I'm happy to see Logain helping the girls (I don't even know what to call them right now..). This is good.</p>

        <p>GARETH BRYNE - I like this. I really like Gareth Bryne.</p>

        <p>ALTEIMA - OH MY MY MY! Gaebril / Rhavin... whoa - it is crazy to see Compulsion happening on the other end. Wow. Scary.</p>

        <p>MORGASE - And Morgase misses Bryne.. aw.</p>

        <h2>Ch 2 - Rhuidean</h2>
        <p>HOLY SMOKES. Everything is so good here. So deep. There is so much good stuff here. So much of the Aiel - so much of Rhuidean. SO MUCH GOOD STUFF. Beautiful writing by Jordan, beautiful worldbuilding by Jordan... so so good. I can't believe we are learning so much so early - that's just my thoughts even though I'm in book five.. it's just so good. I'm so happy.</p>

        <p>Now, about this talk of LTT's Hundred Companions.. I want a full page of names of these companions in one really long sentence - I'm sure RJ could do that! I don't know I just really like the idea of having these named characters for this story of LTT and his Hundred Companions.</p>

        <p>Now, I love the descriptions of sadin and saidar.. beautiful. Also, it is very fascinating that Rand can feel when Moraine and/or Egwene are embracing saidar but he doesn't know who. I wonder if that ability will ever be found.</p>

        <p>Also also, LTT in Rand's head... AWESOME. So much in just the second chapter of this book.. gets me hyped up for the rest of the book!</p>


        <h2>Ch 3 - Pale Shadows</h2>
        <p>I love this chapter. I'm so happy.</p>

        <p>RAND - YES YES YES. Rand + ASMO. YES YES YES.</p>

        <p>I love the way Rand and Asmodean communicate. I am happy that Rand is getting so powerful - this is good!</p>

        <p>MAT - oh Mat, you're awesome. This is so much fun. I'm really happy to be reading these Mat perspectives.... SO GOOD! Mat is awesome. I love this Melindhra as well wink - that was awesome. And I really appreciate Mat trying to get Rand's attention.</p>

        <p>Also, next chapter.. we are still with Rand... YES!</p>

        <h2>Ch 4 - Twilight</h2>
        <p>So good.. Rand is jealous hmm. This is really interesting about Isandre and Rand having to hide that she and Kadere are Darkfriends.</p>

        <h2>CH 5 - Among the Wise Ones</h2>
        <p>I love this. I really haven't been too blown away by Egwene chapters. I just am so excited to read Rand and Mat chapters. But this was a good one. I feel like I really like where Egwene is at in her power, character arc, and everything about her. I hope she goes far in the series - I'm sure she might. But I'm really interested in TAR.</p>

        <p>What the heck is the bleakness?! ... I typed this and then listened to podcast ep 504 on this chapter. I think I understand it now.</p>

        <p>I'm still confused on the Aiel customs, of course. So, Melaine isn't married? but Dorindha is married to Bael? And she wants to marry them?</p>

        <p>And Isendre... what is going on here?! Also, Lanfear / Keille.. is she just gone?</p>

        <h2>Ch 6 - Gateways</h2>
        <p>Well this was awesome. Rand and the Darkhounds.. Mat with Melindhra, what is with this foxhead medallion - does that have something to do with... OH! Mat asked to not have anything to do to deal with Aes Sedai. So with the foxhead medallion - is that where Moiraines Healing was focused on?? HMM I HAVE NO IDEA! Reading on!</p>

        <p>Okay I need to compose my thoughts here. Good GRIEF. I am sitting in my work break room trying to keep myself from jumping up and down. THIS IS ABSOLUTELY INCREDIBLE. WOW WOW WOW.</p>

        <h2>Predictions as of Chapter 6</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Rand will absolutely be able to raise the dead (I have no idea how yet)</li>

        <li>Rand is literally insanely powerful.. that’s the prediction lol</li>
    </ul>
        <p>These books are going to be so jam packed with world building and magic - I can’t even imagine what the later books are going to be like. This is so good.</p>

        <p>Let me talk about Balefire.. WHAT?! IT REMOVES THINGS FROM THE PATTERN.. also thank you Brett for your help on the podcast (wow!). I am really interested in how this Balefire works....</p>

        <h2>Ch 7 - A Departure</h2>
        <p>Hey, whoever said someone clomping around on a horse describing people and their thoughts weren't fun.. have not read this chapter! WHOA. This was great! I really liked this chapter and I'm sure there is an incredible amount of detail that I missed about all the things that Egwene said - but I'm excited to hear how the Ogier are going to rebuild Rhuidean.. that's awesome! I love this Mat / Melindhra duo.. cute lol. And Rand's "until I return.. think of me.." water out of everywhere in Rhuidean.. so cool.</p>

        <p>Now Moiraine.. hmm, she's great. I love seeing her perspectives. Also, is she great?! I'm worried about her. I feel like she is going to die out of nowhere and no one is going to be able to stop it. I'm worried because she is so one-track mind.. and that's the Dragon Reborn fulfilling prophesies, but it just scares me. I don't want her to die. I appreciate her giving Rand her Oath to help her, and I appreciate the openness of all of that, but we'll see. hmm.</p>

        <p>Love this book so far.</p>

        <h2>Ch 8 - Over the Border</h2>
        <p>OOOOOO a Nynaeve perspective.. happy Matt!</p>

        <p>Oh boy, oh boy. This just makes me happy. I'm really glad to have gotten this insight into Nynaeve, Elayne, Thom, and Juilin. I do love their group and how they interact. Let me tell you, all these people *trying* to go to Tar Valon... that is going to be **bad**. I am so scared for all these people on their way.</p>

        <p>Also, Whitecloaks = scary! Dumb, but SCARY! Almost.. like Storm troopers? Is that something Brett has said before, still scary.</p>

        <p>I do love this book so far.</p>

        <h2>Ch 9 - A Signal</h2>
        <p>I mean come on girls… good grief. Why would you drink tea from someone you don’t know who also ISNT DRINKING THE TEA THEMSELVES!</p>

        <p>Also prediction: Nynaeve will overcome this being angry to channel (and I think Mogi helped her inadvertently realize what the issue was - that Nynaeve is scared.. right?) but she will overcome it! That’s my hope!</p>

        <h2>Ch 10 - Figs and Mice</h2>
        <p>I tell you what, I can't even begin to think about where all these pigeons are going. Of course, one is going to Tar Valon, but I have no idea where the other two exact copies are going.</p>

        <p>I am also very happy we get Nynaeve saying "thank you" to Thom and Juilin.. also IS NYNAEVE GOING TO BE A YELLOW AJAH?! WOW! I am interested in Elayne with Black Hair.. I can imagine there is going to be some changes in her life when she comes back into contact with people who know her with her reddish hair. Interesting!</p>

        <p>Loving this so far.</p>

        
        <h2>Ch 11 - The Nine Horse Hitch</h2>
        <p>Back with Siuan, Leane, Min, and Logain! Okay - I'm liking what I'm seeing here. I love being in Siuan's perspective. Siuan is awesome. I'm really enjoying these eyes-and-ears.. we're getting a lot out of this from these recent chapters, but I'm interested in more! Min is great too. I just feel worried about what is going to happen next for this crew. I'm worried that something is going to be bad and I'm just worried. Here we go!</p>
        
       
        <h2>Ch 12 - An Old Pipe</h2>
        <p>I mean is there anyone not to like in these books really? I feel for Bryne. I feel for him in his current predicament and for all he’s had to go through and for all that he is going to try to do. I like him a lot! I’m continuing my worry for Siuan, Min, Leane, and Logain. What is going to happen?!</p>
        
        <h2>Ch 13 - A Small Room in Sienda</h2>
        <p>Okay, first off.. where is Perrin, Faile, Gaul, Bain, Chiad, Loial - where are they all?! We haven't heard anything from them the entire book! Okay, let's talk about this chapter... Okay so we're about to get some TAR.. SWEET! And My guess is possibly that this group and Siuan's group will be close to each other?? I think - if the map looks right.. idk. Otherwise, I'm enjoying this!</p>
        
        <h2>Ch 14 - Meetings</h2>
        <p>Oh Nynaeve.. Okay let's get into it! Wow. I love this chapter. We get Birgitte in TAR and more info about Forsaken + Heroes in TAR and that Gaidal Cain has been born again.. wow. Great stuff! Learning about Mogi's name in the Old Tongue gets me excited to learn what Lanfear means haha! OH THE PRESCRIPTS! WHO HAS IMPLIMENTED THOSE. HOW DO THEY WORK?! Okay, Egwene and Melaine with Nynaeve. Hmm. Nynaeve is about to burst! And as this chapter ends... good grief Nynaeve - she is going to get herself in big trouble.</p>
        
        <h2>Ch 15 - What Can Be Learned in Dreams</h2>
        <p>I am glad Egwene and Nynaeve finally know that Elaida is Amyrlin! Man I felt like a friend in an awkward conversation with two lifelong friends with the conversation between Egwene and Nynaeve. I mean it was difficult to read since I felt for Nynaeve but Egwene was GOING OFF on Nynaeve. I also hope to see the Blues that are left. I can't believe that they're all dead. I just hope they're safe. Now reading Egwene’s perspective! I LOVE WHEN EGWENE TALKS ABOUT HER DREAMS! YES! Okay, Rand sitting down in a chat - not his chair a woman's chair... OH WOW. THE AMYRLIN'S SEAT?! Is Rand going to sit in the Amyrlin's seat?? That's gotta be the seat.. right? Perrin and Faile - with the Manetheran Banner and the Wolf's head banner.. nice. And the Tinker (ARAM), why does Egwene feel a chill of doom when he gets close to Perrin?? OH NO! Mat with his dice and wound.. hmm. Thom reaching in a fire to bring out the blue stone that is apparenlty on Moraine's forhead... WHAT?!?!?! Are Thom and Moiraine connected in some way or will be connected in some way?? Lastly a storm with lightning bolts.. spooky. Oh this book is so enjoyable. In my lifetime, I've ridden a horse twice. And it was so incredible. This book is reinvigorating that love - oh wow I can just remember how it felt hopping up into the stirrups and galloping along. AHHHH SOO GOOD!</p>
        
        <p>Okay... Egwene feeling close to choosing her Ajah! What in the world would she choose? I mean, I feel after this conversation she's looking very Blue to me. But really, I don't think I know of every Ajah in depth. Nynaeve, I feel, is looking for Yellow (healing). And Elayne has thought about Green (battle!), but I don't know if she will actually choose that. A lot is still up in the air!</p>
        
        <p>LOVE THIS BOOK!</p>
        
        <h2>Ch 16 - An Unexpected Offer</h2>
        <p>AHHHHHH!!! If you can't tell I'm screaming. Whoa, this is crazy and exciting and I'm so down for it. We are getting more of this menagerie... I can't wait! Am I to understand that Thom and Juilin will go with them? Okay, Galad. Wow. He is SCARY! At least what he can do is scary. And he says that Siuan has been stilled and executed! Nynaeve and Elayne are shaken... Thankfully we know that's not true. Now let's talk Thom and Elayne...... I imagine a kiss is necessary but nothing more will come of it - that's my prediction. Thom will be the one to call it off. That's what I think. Oh this is so good.</p>
        
        <h2>Ch 17 - Heading West</h2>
        <p>THE CIRCUS! Or the menagerie.. lol I’m excited. I love Valan Luca, I’m interested to see what his character does when paired with Nynaeve, Elayne, Thom, and Juilin - he seems quite the showman and I’m excited. Oh oh the SEANCHAN! Yup that’s going to get wild I think. very interesting how subservient she’s acting… interesting. Holy smokes.. ALUDRA! The Illuminator Mat and Thom met! Onto a LIANDRIN perspective, WHAT?!</p>
        
        <h2>Ch 18 - A Hound for Darkness</h2>
        <p>Okay I was excited about a Loandrin perspective, and then Moghedien shows up?! Wow! A good and SCARY chapter. Wow. This is going to be good. I mean bad. I mean good. Oh this is going to be awesome! I’m very worried about Nynaeve and Elayne now - this is going to be bad for them and I don’t want that. Wow, Moghedien is scary.</p>

        <h2>Ch 19 - Memories</h2>
        <p>Okay, I did not expect a chapter with Morgase as the POV and Fain as the second POV to be my favorite chapter of this book so far but GOOD GRIEF. I also don't think that's true, but this chapter is up there with the earlier Rhuidean chapters... well really, this WHOLE BOOK IS AMAZING! Okay let's get into this... Wow, I was really feeling horrible for Morgase here - she's Compelled by Gaebril / Rhavin but not all the time and that's torture. Oh I felt so bad for her here. And then we get Tallanvor.. love him - he's such a good guy. Loves his Queen Morgase! WOO! And we get Lini! That's awesome. Love this. I love it all. And I'm really glad we get to see them all leave safely. I was really worried. So much awesome happened in Morgase's POV it almost couldn't have been topped.. and then we get a FAIN POV.. YES!</p>
        
        <p>Okay Fain.. Padan Fain, Mordeith, Master Fain.... WHOA. I mean talk about a plot bombshell here - Shayol Ghul and his experience with Shayol Ghul.. GOOD GRIEF. And Fain gets the dagger back and he kills Verine (accepted) and then Alviarin is Black Ajah (i'm too hyped up on this chapter to remember, but I think we definitely knew that already). But this talk of Thakan'dar... SO SO GOOD. SO SO GOOD. Also, Fain nicked himself, I don't guess that will be much an issue for him.. right?</p>
        
        <h2>Ch 20 - Jangai Pass</h2>
        <p>Shoot. This is good. I’m loving this Rand. He Who Comes With the Dawn and The Dragon Reborn looks good on Rand lol. He has such power and it’s just so cool. RJ is such a beautiful writer. I’m impressed! And now, this is getting rowdy. Couladin is crazy and I have literally no idea what to expect from him. What on earth is he going to do to Rand and these Aiel?! Also, Mat is so good. So so good. And wait wait! Is this the first we’ve gotten full written description of Laman’s Sin?? Whoa!</p>
        
        <h2>Ch 21 - The Gift of a Blade</h2>
        <p>Good golly Aviendha! LAMAN'S SWORD?! Wow, that's awesome! I expect Rand to keep this sword for a long time, possible put it up on a wall behind a desk as he commands an Army or something like that... that'd be cool. Or he could use it? Or does he need to use it anymore, since he can channel? It seems like a remarkable sword. Okay, I am glad Rand is able to set a ward across the whole camp against Shadowspawn, that's awesome. Will Mat take up his Spear for Melindhra.. hmm. Maybe!</p>
        
        <h2>Ch 22 - Birdcalls at Night</h2>
        <p>I tell you what, this book is ramping up to something big! Woo! Oh wow, this is really awesome. Not just for Mat getting a little frisky with Melindhra, but everything. This is such a cool book, a cool series, and incredible characters. Wow. This is awesome. Do we really think Asmo cares that Rand is saying things that LTT is / did say? How do I even communicate this.. Rand has LTT in his head, because Rand is the Dragon Reborn, the Dragon being LTT. The Heroes of the Horn called him LTT because that’s what they see - Rand’s soul / LTT’s soul. So this is LTT being part of Rand in the things he is saying and thinking. That’s my prediction, although, I think it’s pretty clear right??</p>
        
        <h2>Ch 23 - "The Fifth, I Give You"</h2>
        <p>I love Rand in charge. Wow, this is so great to see! From what we saw in TEOTW to now.. this is great! Although, I fear there is going to be some bad things coming Rand and the Aiel's way - Couladin and such. But I'm just worried about Aviendha (she is getting pushed around and I don't like it!). Also, I feel we are gearing up for something HUGE!</p>
        
        <h2>Ch 24 - A Message Sent</h2>
        <p>Yeesh. This is good. I forgot that Egwene doesn't know about the Heroes of the Horn being in TAR. Interetsing. Should I care about this fight with Nynaeve and Chavana (or those people in the Menagerie?)
        I'm not sure if I've said this before but this Mat + Daughter of the Nine Moons is CERTAINLY A SEANCHAN. WHOA. That's crazy, right? I imagine the Seanchan will eventually become less and less of a threat.</p>
        
        <h2>Ch 25 - Dreams of Galad</h2>
        <p>WHAT DID I JUST READ... WHOA! I appreciate that we got the Mogi perspective to tell us what the heck was happening with Egwene's dreams here. I was confused so I was happy to see that Mogi can literally weave the Power around you and make you have dreams that Mogi wants you to have.... THE IMPLICATIONS?! Mogi said that Birgitte was then known as Teadra (I'm saving that nugget for later).</p>
        
        <h2>Ch 26 - Sallie Daera</h2>
        <p>Everytime I see this word now I think of Solidarity. Not sure if that has any implications. Okay whoa! WE HAVE MADE IT TO SALIDAR! I am happy to see all these Aes Sedai and Warders are safe and sound. That is great! Oh no Logain. I don’t know why I thought anything could be helped with Logain. I don’t think this is the last we see from Logain - I think we might be expected to believe he might be close to killing himself. I just don’t know.</p>
        
        <p>Maybe I’m too optimistic to see everyone safe and sound.</p>
        
        <h2>Ch 27 - The Practice of Diffidence</h2>
        <p>WHO IS GOING TO BE THE NEW AMYRLIN?! Who could they choose? I kinda hope it'll be Rand.. but I don't think that'll be the case at all. Maybe they're thinking Egwene???? Here's hoping! I really enjoyed this chapter. Lots of Politicing. Also, Bryne caught up! HERE WE GO!</p>
        
        <h2>Ch 28 - Trapped</h2>
        <p>GARYTH BRYNE IS AWESOME. Okay, he knows about Siuan now with her being stilled. I appreciate him. I think. He’s really smart and I’m super excited for what is going to happen now. Okay Aes Sedai agelessness. I still don’t know what it comes from and am now confused. So my imagination was Siuan would be like (let’s say..) 100 years old. She would look 50 (or something) with no wrinkles and things like that. But from what I’m reading it seems like the agelessness is going away from Siuan since she’s been stilled but she seems to be looking younger??  Crazy</p>
        
        <p>Min! Okay wow. I’m terrified of Logain. And this viewing of Bryne. Bull ripping roses off its neck. That’s clearly his allegiance with Morgase, but that makes no sense! Also Siuan has something to do with it. Hmmmmmm. Also, everyone just needs to chill out and let the Wheel Weave its Pattern. Everyone getting upset over situations that occur from things they themselves create… gotta calm down!</p>
        
        <h2>Ch 29 - Memories of Saldea</h2>
        <p>Holy crap. Holy crap. That was insane. Kadere murdering Isendre. Holy crap. That was crazy! Okay, so was this the first full on mention of “making love” in the series. Wow. And for it to be forced by a Darkfriend to get information. Good grief. Holy crap.</p>
        
        <h2>Ch 30 - A Wager</h2>
        <p>I'll wager this: I don't think we are going to see Perrin, Faile, Loial, or that crew this book. That's interesting.. I'll also wager that I have no idea what is going to happen for the rest of this book. SO MUCH COULD HAPPEN! This was a nice chapter, if not a little weird. I'm confused, but I think I get it. People in Cairhien came to Rand (with the help of some Aiel) and now they're going back to Cairhien to then come back to Rand and report? Right? Okay, sounds good.</p>
        
        <p>Also, Rand is rich.</p>
        
        <h2>Ch 31 - The Far Snows</h2>
        <p>Oh my my my *blushing face*. haha! Wow RJ. This was absolutely beautiful. Completely amazing. So cool to see this in the perspective of the Wheel of Time and the magic system. This was so much better because we've had so many books being built up with the embarassment of nakedness and such. That has been hounded to us about that and then we get this piece of Aviendha trying to wash like Rand has. Oh so beautiful. AND THEN AVIENDHA TRAVELS?! WOW WOW WOW! As soon as Aviendha Travelled and went running and then fell into the water.. oh my. I certainly thought she was going to die. This was it for me. I thought Rand was going to have to come back and try to communicate what happened. I was preparing myself.</p>
            
        <p>And then... wink, we did not get that! SO COOL that Rand could build an igloo with the Power, that's awesome! And how beautiful was this chapter written?? So beautiful.</p>
        
        <p>And preditiction: Rand and Aviendha will marry. Somehow.. not sure whose customs they'll follow. But they will!</p>
        
        <p>So cute.</p>

        <h2>Ch 32 - A Short Spear</h2>
        <p>Whoa, okay. That was awesome. So bending light makes things invisible. Hmm. Interesting. And Rand has the Seanchan short spear now, that’s cool! I trust Asmo.. don’t you? At least I hope we can trust him.</p>

        <h2>Ch 33 - A Question in Crimson</h2>
        <p>Whoa whoa whoa, ELAYNE KNOWS HOW TO MAKE A TER’ANGREAL?! How is that possible? Was she just looking at it and channeling around it to understand it?! Confused Matt, but an excited Matt for sure! Also, love that Nynaeve is the person to get the knives thrown at her… classic. And Elayne certainly wants to walk the tightrope for people. And I’m nervous about Galad being so close! But hopefully we’ll see The Prophet… Masema! Woo!</p>

        <h2>Ch 34 - A Silver Arrow</h2>
        <p>Good gracious! Whoa... Okay, let's dissect. So Brigitte is certainly not dead, of course - we didn't see a body. And WOW. I thought we were going to get a Forsaken death or a Hero death and I was all for it! WOW THAT WAS CRAZY! Now Liandrin... I can't say I'm sad for her, she brought it all on herself. Really and truly.</p>

        <h2>Ch 35 - Ripped Away</h2>
        <p>AHHHH! ELAYNE! BRIGITTE IS ELAYEN’S WARDER?! A FEMALE WARDER?! WHAT DOES THAT MEAN FOR ELAYNE? WHAT DOES THAT MEAN FOR BRIGITTE?! WHAT DOES THAT MEAN FOR RAND?! Oh the implications! What does that mean, as Nynaeve said, for the Wheel?! Brigitte was bound to the wheel! Brigitte can die now for good.. right?!</p>

        <p>Also, is this apart of Min’s viewing of Rand: 3 women, 1 Min, 1 Elayne, and 1 Rand hadn’t didn’t know yet. Or is that just Aviendha and we are just to assume Birgitte will die? Oh Brigitte. What a chapter!</p>

        <h2>Ch 36 - A New Name</h2>
        <p>YES YES YES! BIRGITTE! Whoops sorry, Maerion.. haha I thought that was very funny when Luca said “trying to look like Birgitte huh?” Oh this is so good. Elayne with Birgitte as her WARDER! That is so awesome.</p>

        <h2>Ch 37 Performances in Samara </h2>
        <p>Oh oh! This was AWESOME! I am happy to see this written. It’s a super cool way of telling about this menagerie. I love that Nynaeve and Birgitte are dressed the same. Oh oh, and Birgitte is so right. Nynaeve can’t take back what happened so there is no point to act like this. Go Birgitte. This is awesome! Wait, was that Uno and not Masema?!! For this whole time I thought it was Masema!!</p>

        <h2>Ch 38 - An Old Acquaintance</h2>
        <p>I was wrong, Masema is the Bloody Prophet! It was a bit of bait and switch for me, or I'm just bad at reading. I thought that Uno was the Prophet.. lol. Turns out, it's Masema. Also, I love Uno, oh he's so bloody awesome. And Uno and Nynaeve are going into town.. alright. Here we go.</p>

        <h2>Ch 39 - Encounters in Samara</h2>
        <p>Let me tell you.... Masema (the Prophet) is SCARY! He could snap at any second, and that is the reason why he is so scary. All of his followers makes it EVEN WORSE.. WHOA! I love Uno and Ragan.. so good. And... oh no Galad! WHAT IS GOING TO HAPPEN?!</p>

        <h2>Ch 40 - The Wheel Weaves</h2>
        <p>Love chapters with this title. GALAD, oh I’m glad (haha pun) we can trust Galad. At least I trust Elayne who trusts Galad. So we’re going to be good right?? Oh please be good. I really don’t know where to expect the crew to go? Are they going to Salidar? That’d be awesome. We’d meet up with Siuan, Min, Leane, Logain, a lot of Aes Sedai (I’m still learning their names Brett!), and Bryne. Unless they’re all leaving. I’m happy to be here. Loving this book so far!</p>

        <h2>Ch 41 - The Craft of Kin Tovere</h2>
        <p>Five miles to Cirhien.. we are so close! I'm glad to be back in a Rand perspective. I imagine this book is about to POP OFF. I just turned to page 600 or 888. So, still got a lot of story left in this book, and I'm constantly amazed that I am on Book 5 of 14 total.. haha I've got a long way to go. And I'm so so happy to be here. Wow. Okay, who threw this spear.... hmm. Also, I know Dani and Brett in a podcast episode said that Asmo gave Couladin his dragons on his arms, but had we known that before? Or was this the first time we heard that? Also, next chapter is a Mat perspective... yipee!</p>


        <h2>Ch 42 - Before the Arrow</h2>
        <p>WE ARE ABOUT TO HAVE A BATTLE! I'm pumped. Alright, I've said it before, and I'll continue saying it... I love Mat. He is awesome. I'm so interested to learn more about what the heck is going on with him and wow - it's just so awesome to read his perspectives. And Rand... hmm, sending in Lan to talk with Mat.. devious. What could it mean that Rand's ta'veren pull seems to be weakening.. maybe it's weakening so that something big can happen to bring them all back. I don't know, but I'll be excited to see the boys back together. THIS IS SO GOOD.</p>
        
        <h2>Ch 43 - This Place, This Day</h2>
        <p>I do believe we're seeing the.. Fires from Heaven! Oh man, oh man, this is so awesome! This is getting so so good. I love how RJ writes battle scenes. This is so epic. Mat is awesome, Egwene and Aviendha are awesome, Lan and Rand are awesome. This is so so good. Mat is freaking cool. I'm serious. This is awesome! Reading on!</p>
        
        <h2>Ch 44 - The Lesser Sadness</h2>
        <p>What? I'm sorry what? What just happened? Rand lost hours in the day? How? I'm confused.. what?? I thought we were going to see the battle - we saw most of it. I really wanted to know what happened to Couladin.. and I'm sure we will. I don't think he's been accounted for.. I'm guessing RAFO. And I am certainly reading on. But whoa. This chapter was a crazy ride.</p>
        
        <h2>Ch 45 - After the Storm</h2>
        <p>Hey hey, questions: answered! We won! And Mat killed Couladin... that's AWESOME! Mat really is a good fighter it seems. Whoa - a lot more here. I want to trust Asmodean so badly, I really do. I couldn't help but notice the way the last chapter ended with Rand thinking that Asmo weaved the One Power at him... sketchy!!!! But this is good. Things are not resolved and the Game of Houses is afoot! And Rand is going to be brought into Cairhien in a nice procession.</p>
                
        <h2>Ch 46 - Other Battles, Other Weapons</h2>
        <p>I tell ya, I love this. I love this Rand being a king of sorts and giving commands. And whoops Aiel couldn't find Isendre.. I wonder why? (sarcasm - ch 29). This seems like a small chapter, but it might be big right? With big implications? The swearing of fealty and such. This is great! Game of Houses!</p>
        
        <p>WHO DOES RAND WANT ON THE SUN THRONE?!</p>
        
        <h2>Ch 47 - The Price of a Ship</h2>
        <p>I couldn't have imagined that both Masema and Galad would find the same boat.. haha. That's hilarious! Also, Birgitte... better be careful spouting off all those AOL references... And Birgitte and Uno, hmm. Okay, and I'm pumped about this whole crew going to this boat... oooo, this is going to be good!</p>
        
        <p>This was a fun chapter to read!  I really like the Birgitte / Elayne dynamic. I trust Birgitte. I really can't imagine a better warder for Birgitte. And what's all this about Elayne bonding Rand. Is that possible? Is that what's going to happen? Rand can't be a Warder can he? Or can ayone be a warder? Also, Asa is Seanchan... that is interesting! Woo!</p>
        
        <h2>Ch 48 - Leavetakings</h2>
        <p>I LOVE THIS BOOK. I LOVE THIS BOOK SERIES. I love this so much. Not only do I get so excited when RJ describes people packing up to leave - I also love chapters with Leavetakings as the title! THIS IS SO GOOD. And wow, I just love this crew coming into Samara and wrecking these people... whoa GALAD! WOOP! Okay, Galad, you earned some points for me in this chapter.</p>
                
        <h2>Ch 49 - To Boannda</h2>
        <p>A lot happened in all these pages. Okay, I love boat scenes. Oh I love it so much. I am not in agreement that because they're some distance away from Samara that channelling will not bring Mogi. She is Forsaken.. she will find them... SCARY! I love that Nynaeve cares so much for these people - for all people really. She is totally going YELLOW AJAH!</p>
        
        <p>I want to jump to the Two Rivers here.. Okay, the three story house is their for Perrin and Faile or for Loial.. because Loial is huge! And I bet we see them all next book.. like this book is all these people, but next book we will only get Perrin and Faile.. I think that makes sense right? Because we've been with Rand and Crew and Siuan and Crew and Nynaeve and Crew this book. I don't know. I'm excited to read on though!</p>
        
        <p>Okay, so I have absolutely no idea how the dream ter'angrael works, and I'm sure I'm not supposed to yet. But it is... interesting. This was a good chapter. Good Nynaeve and Elayne.</p>
        
        <p>Prediction time.. what the heck is going to happen when all these people come to Salidar. Whoa. I mean Birgitte is there, but no one knows that she's Birgitte so that's good. These three random women and their children... I smell Darkfriend. I smell it! I'm just excited to read and find out!</p>
        
        <h2>Ch 50 - To Teach, and Learn</h2>
        <p>WHO IS THE THIRD WOMAN?! Did I misread that Min said the third would be Cairhienin? I mean I’ve been thinking this whole time it’s Avihenda… am I being led astray by this Cairhienin thing?? Hmm.</p>
        
        <p>Okay, what the heck does Stilling do?! How could Siuan and Leane keep looking younger? How old does agelessness look like?! What is going on?! This was a good chapter. I love the back and forth with Bryne and Thom. This is so good. I literally have no idea what is going to happen to close this book out. None. No ideas at all. </p>
          
        <h2>Ch 51 - News Comes to Cairhien</h2>
        <p>HO-LY SMOKES! This is going to be huge! I love reading Rand in power of a nation. Oh wow. So good. Commanding people, this is so cool to see after so many pages from where it all started in Emond’s Field. I love Egwene, Avihenda, and Moiraine as Rand’s somewhat advisors. This is great! I love Mat - he’s so funny and awesome. This Red Hand thing is super cool! Wow! And Moiraine’s blue jewel on her head… why does it keep shining when she’s complimenting the boys. Hmm. </p>
        
        <p>Moegase is not dead, we know she’s not. She can’t be. </p>
        
        <p>OH MAT... MELINDHRA NOOOOO. Welp. Melindhra was a Darkfriend... that sucks. And Mat's first kill of a woman. And something about these Dice spinning in his head... what could that mean?! What the heck just happened?! WHOA!</p>
        
        <h2>Ch 52 - Choices</h2>
        <p>LANFEAR!!!!!! OH MY GOOODNESS!!!!!! This is absolutely crazy. Where the heck are the Maidens. What is happening?! LANFEAR!! Oh wow. This is crazy. I love that Lanfear is doing this because Rand slept with Aviendha.. lol. But this is absolutely crazy. Rand isn't able to see her weaves but he is able to feel them? He's at least able to feel them enough to block them from shielding him. Which is awesome. This is crazy. Lanfear and Moiraine battling into the twisted red doorway.... WHAT IS GOING TO HAPPEN?!</p>
        
        <h2>Ch 53 - Fading Words</h2>
        <p>Moiraine is not dead. There is no way. Lanfear and Moiraine are just in the place that leads from the doorway.. that's it.. right?? Please let that be right. </p>
        <p>Okay, this Maiden business is freaking awesome. The end of this chapter made me think of the music that plays in action movies right before the climax... A building of something AWESOME IS ABOUT TO HAPPEN!!! WOOO! I love Mat lol. </p>
        
        <p>What is in this Thom letter huh ;)? I seriously doubt Moiraine is dead. Seriously. Maybe that's why people read New Spring after FOH.. hmm.</p>
        
        <h2>Ch 54 - To Camelyn</h2>
        <p>Dear Lord. Whoa! This was awesome!! Rand opening a Gateway with a BUNCH OF AIEL, to then be trapped by Rhavin.. WHOA, then Rand Gatewaying into the Royal Palace and RJ writing “He was death.” WOW WOW WOW. </p>
        
        <p>And Nynaeve and Siuan, wow. Okay, so I really hope Nynaeve can get past this block. And boom, Mogi. And boom, Birgitte. Golly! So much happened and quick thinking with the a’dam Nynaeve. </p>
        
        <p>In this chapter... Asmodean, Aviendha, and Mat were killed by Ravhin.</p>
        
        <p>Now, I have literally no idea what is going to happen lol. Here we go! </p>
        
        <h2>Ch 55 - The Threads Burn</h2>
        <p>Rahvin is dead. Leave it at that. Rahvin is dead. WHOA!!! Balefire. Nynaeve and Mogi in TAR with Rand and Rahvin in TAR. This was CRAZY!!!! Very interesting that Rahvin opened a Gateway that could turn Rand into a.. Trolloc? right? I'm sure it's RAFO, but that is super neat! GOLLY! THIS WAS AWESOME!</p>
        
        <h2>Ch 56 - Glowing Embers</h2>
        <p>Well well well, the end of the Fifth Book of the Wheel of Time.... WOW! I love that Rand got to meet Davram Bashere, because that's Faile's father right?? That's cool. Also, I LOVE THIS PLAN by Rand to work with all the Male Channelers that can be found to come to him. WHOA THAT IS GOING TO BE SO EPIC.</p>
        
        <p>AND ELAYNE AS QUEEN OF ANDOR YES! Well, until Morgase comes back... that'll be a fun reunion.</p>
        
        <p>I have heard of this before but... WHO KILLED ASMODEAN?! Haha, this was crazy. Here's my guess... it's not an Aes Sedai (three oaths and such), but it had to have been someone who knew Asmo as Asmo. So, I'm guessing another Chosen / Forsaken. Probably not Lanfear since she and Moiraine are off elsewhere right now. Hmm.</p>
        
        <p>And Morgase.. I knew she was still alive! I knew it!</p>
        
        <p>Rand balefire'd Ravhin so hard that Asmo, Aviendha, and Mat being killed was reversed. INSANE.</p>
