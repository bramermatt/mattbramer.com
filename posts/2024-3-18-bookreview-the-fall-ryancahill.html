<h2 id="written">Written Review</h2>
<p>Okay, this is exactly what I needed to read right now. A 100 page prequel story to a fantasy series about dragon riders, mages, sentinel armored magic people. Oh wow, am I excited to read more of this! </p>

<p>This book, specifically, was a "one incident - multiple perspective" story. And that was great! I love fantasy and I had just read The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings, so I might've been a little burnt out of BIG EPIC FANTASY, but this was awesome to read. </p>

<p>I struggled a bit, and I'll get into that in just a second, but I look forward to reading more in this world and I hope the writing improves. I was a bit distracted by the prose and the dialogue, but that is only nitpicking after reading J.R.R. Tolkien. This was still an incredibly engaging story!</p>

<p><strong>Dragon rider fantasy, epic magic, sword fighting, multiple races, exciting plot, what more could you ask for?! And this is free for those who want to try it out! </strong></p>

<h2>Parts 1 & 2</h2>
<p>Hey, I like this. This is an exciting story. I enjoy this writing style, it feels to me a little.. and juvenile is not the right word. I just feel the prose is lacking a bit. And that's just my personal preference. A really engaging story so far, I think this is checking all the boxes for an incredible fantasy story. This is only the prequel to the series in which I expect the story and prose to improve! One can hope! I also really appreciate this style, one event, seeing it from multiple perspectives. You can't do that all the time, but a condensed narrative in a small format is a great place to do so!</p>

<h2>Part 3</h2>
<p>Really enjoying this story so far, even with the dialogue and the prose glaring at me as I read. I am enjoying this story! I mean, I just read J.R.R. Tolkien's The Lord of the Rings, of course I'm going to be comparing that to the prose here. </p>

<h2>Part 4</h2>
<p>The best of the four parts! Getting to see Eltoar's perspective here was awesome. Really giving more to a character who felt very one-note at the beginning of this book. Awesome display of power and prowess. Just great stuff here, I'm excited to read more! </p>
