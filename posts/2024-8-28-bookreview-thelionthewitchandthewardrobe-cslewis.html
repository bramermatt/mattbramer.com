<h2>Written Review</h2>
<p>The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe by C.S. Lewis is a classic that totally lives up to the hype. I finally got around to reading it after only ever seeing the movie adaptations, and let me tell you, the book adds so much more depth to the story. One of the first things that struck me was how much it reminded me of Tolkien’s The Fellowship of the Ring. The way Lewis tells the story feels similar—he’s got that same knack for pulling you into a fully-realized world where everything is just a little more magical.</p>

<p>Narnia itself is brought to life in such a vivid way, and it’s really cool to see it through the eyes of the Pevensie kids—Peter, Susan, Edmund, and Lucy. As they step into this strange new world, you can’t help but feel like you’re discovering it right along with them. That’s one of the things I love about how Lewis wrote this; you’re not just reading about Narnia, you’re experiencing it.</p>

<p>The comparison to Tolkien doesn’t stop at world-building, either. Lewis’s narrative style, with that slightly all-knowing narrator who gives you little insights into what the characters are thinking, really reminded me of how Tolkien handled the narration in The Fellowship of the Ring. There’s a certain warmth and familiarity in the way the story is told that makes it feel like an old friend is guiding you through this epic adventure.</p>

<p>Since I’d only ever seen the movies, I was pleasantly surprised by how much more there was to the characters and the story in the book. Edmund’s journey, for instance, is explored with way more depth in the book. You get a real sense of his inner turmoil and guilt, which makes his eventual redemption feel so much more earned. The movie did a good job, but the book just adds those extra layers that make the story richer.</p>

<p>Sure, the story is aimed at younger readers, and there are definitely some parts that feel a bit childish—talking animals, a clear-cut battle between good and evil, and a pretty straightforward plot. But honestly, that’s part of the charm. It’s what makes this book so timeless. There’s a reason it’s still a favorite after all these years. The simplicity of the story actually allows the bigger themes to come through more clearly, so it’s a book that can be enjoyed whether you’re a kid or an adult.</p>

<p>Now, let’s talk about the Christian themes, because they’re definitely there. I knew going in that there would be some Christian symbolism, and it was interesting to see how Lewis wove these elements into the narrative. Aslan, the majestic lion, is the most obvious symbol, representing Christ with his sacrificial death and resurrection. But even if you’re not reading it for the religious aspects, these themes of sacrifice, redemption, and the triumph of good over evil resonate on a universal level. They add a layer of depth to the story that makes it more than just a simple fantasy tale.</p>

<p>One thing I really appreciate about Lewis’s writing is how he balances these Christian themes with the adventure and fantasy elements. The Christian allegory is there if you want to see it, but it doesn’t overshadow the story or feel preachy. It’s just part of the fabric of the world Lewis has created, which makes it feel natural and seamless.</p>

<p>Another thing I loved was how the book handles the themes of courage and leadership. Watching the Pevensie kids, especially Peter and Edmund, grow into their roles as leaders was really inspiring. Their journey from ordinary kids to the leaders of Narnia’s resistance against the White Witch is a great example of how anyone can rise to the occasion when needed. It’s a common theme in fantasy, but Lewis does it really well here.</p>

<p>The writing itself is straightforward and easy to read, which I appreciated. There’s no unnecessary fluff—every sentence serves a purpose, and the pacing keeps you engaged from start to finish. It’s clear that Lewis wrote this book with a younger audience in mind, but there’s enough sophistication in the prose that it doesn’t feel like it’s just for kids. It’s the kind of book you can enjoy at any age, which is probably why it’s stayed so popular over the years.</p>

<p>To sum it up, The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe is a fantastic blend of fantasy, adventure, and deeper themes. The way Lewis writes feels a lot like Tolkien, which is a big plus in my book. Even though the story has some childish elements and obvious Christian overtones, it’s still a great read with a lot to offer. Whether you’re revisiting it as an adult or reading it for the first time, there’s something in this book for everyone. It’s a classic for a reason, and after reading it, I totally get why.</p>
