                 <h2>Review</h2>
                <p>I picked up Strange New World hoping for a biblically rooted response to the sexual revolution—something that would engage with the cultural moment through the lens of Scripture. While Carl Trueman does offer a helpful, and at times necessary, primer on how Western thought drifted into today’s expressive individualism, this book didn’t deliver what I had hoped for. This book is heavy on philosophy and not theology. </p>

                <p>This work is a shortened and “more accessible” version of Trueman’s much longer and more scholarly and dense book, The Rise and Triumph of the Modern Self. And it definitely feels that way: condensed, concise, and… surface level. I think it was too condensed, honestly, I wanted more. </p>

                <h2>Content</h2>
                <p>Trueman follows the intellectual journey from Jean-Jacques Rousseau to Sigmund Freud, tracing how philosophical and psychological shifts gradually redefined identity, morality, and sexuality—culminating in today’s sexual revolution. Rousseau laid the groundwork with his idea that true identity is found within the self, not shaped by societal expectations or traditions. The beginning of the end, in my opinion</p>

                <p>That turn was picked up by Romantic thinkers who celebrated personal expression as the highest virtue, “my truth”. Friedrich Nietzsche and Karl Marx then deconstructed morality and religion, paving the way for a world where God is no longer the source of truth or authority. </p>

                <p>Finally, Freud sexualized the self, teaching that human identity is fundamentally rooted in sexual desire—and that repression of those desires leads to psychological harm. These ideas, once confined to academic circles, eventually filtered down into pop-culture through activists, institutions, and media. </p>

                <p>If you’ve never studied the history or philosophy behind modern identity politics, Strange New World may serve as a strong on-ramp, it certainly was the starting place for me. Trueman seems to do well at connecting dots across centuries and thinkers, showing how today’s debates didn’t arise overnight—they are the result of a long and deliberate re-imagining of the self.</p>

                <p>But if you're looking for a theological or exegetical critique of gender and sexuality ideologies—this book isn't it. There are very few direct biblical responses or sustained scriptural engagements. And to be fair, Trueman doesn’t necessarily promise them, and I should’ve paid more attention to that.</p>

                <h2>Author’s Intent</h2>
                <p>His goal is to diagnose the cultural moment and in that sense, Strange New World functions more as a Christian sociology rather than an apologetic or theological response. Something that I was actually wanting out of this book.</p>

                <p>In this, my reaction seems to line up with many other readers and reviewers. Strange New World is widely appreciated for what it is—a clear and concise overview of how we got here culturally—but it’s also commonly noted that it lacks depth, particularly in offering a robust biblical response. It diagnoses the problem well but doesn’t walk you through the remedy. It’s a solid summary, not a full treatment. Of course, we have to remember this is a concise work based on a much larger work — I wonder if that work, The Rise and Triumph of the Modern Self, does anymore towards the biblical response.</p>

                <p>That said, Trueman’s writing is clear, calm, and level-headed. He exposes the inner logic of our culture, and I certainly appreciate that. Still, for readers like me who are deeply invested in thinking biblically about these shifts—not just culturally or historically—it may feel incomplete. I walked away understanding better how we got here, but not much more equipped to speak the truth in love to those immersed in this worldview.</p>

                <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
                <p>Strange New World is a valuable summary of ideas—but not a full-bodied Christian response. It shows us the world’s logic, but not God’s. For that, we’ll need to keep turning the pages—of Scripture first and foremost, and perhaps beyond this book as well.</p>
