    <h2>My Problem</h2>
    <p>I've been having a problem with YouTube.com ever since YouTube Shorts became a reality..</p>

    <p>YouTube Shorts have impeded on my YouTube subscriptions, when I feel that should not happen. When I go to select Subscriptions - I'd expect to see videos from my subscriptions, but I see videos <em>and</em> YouTube Shorts. Which makes sense, but I'd really like to be able to separate the Shorts from the Videos.. but I cannot.</p>

    <h2>Subscriptions Tab</h2>
    <p>I'd love to be able to browse the Subscriptions tab.. and see I also have the same problem on mobile! I can't escape YouTube Shorts.</p>

    <h2>YouTube Home</h2>
    <p>I've been doing a lot of my YouTube browsing exclusively within the Home tab.. as seen below. I like this tab because I get to see recommended videos and also my subscriptions. And, as you can see from the screenshot.. Shorts are separated! That's what I like to see.</p>

    <h2>YouTube Shorts</h2>
    <p>Now don't get me wrong, I love watching YouTube Shorts, when I want to watch them.. they're great! Really, more often than not, just a <em>remix</em> of a TikTok, but still nice.</p>

    <h2>Please YouTube</h2>
    <p>Please YouTube, give me a separator tab for Shorts and Subscriptions.</p>
