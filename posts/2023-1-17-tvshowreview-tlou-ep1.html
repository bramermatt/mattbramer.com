                <h2>Written Review</h2>
    <p>oh my my my, this was perfect. This was so so good. This is exactly how any on screen adaptation <em>should be done</em>. From everything from the theme music to the way the show handled the story.. perfect. I loved it! I really think I need to replay the games and review them.. maybe.</p>

    <h2>Spoilers Ahead</h2>
    <p>Click at your own risk!</p>

    <details>
    <summary>Spoilers...</summary>
    <p>I will be spoiling the show, and also the first game as well. Please be warned.</p>

    <h2>Sarah</h2>
    <p>Oh holy cow, Sarah is spectacular! We knew this character that was going to die, and I really enjoyed the way the story delved more into this backstory as we saw in the show.</p>

    <h2>The Watch</h2>
    <p>In this show, we got more about this watch that Joel wears, and I loved the way the show portrayed the watch being fixed from Sarah's perspective, because in the game we didn't see that part. But the show just made it so much more impactful and we got the "I sell hardcore drugs" line from Sarah and wow, beautiful. We also got the "your watch is broken" line from Ellie later in the show... ALL THE FEELS.</p>

    <h2>The Scene</h2>
    <p>There is a scene.. of Sarah dying. And the game, if you didn't know about it happening before you played the game, and if you didn't know what was going to happen in the show.. wow. POWERFUL.</p>

    <h2>The Scene from My Perspective</h2>
    <p>I started to film myself playing the game, in 2017, but I only recorded 5 episodes - maybe I'll get back to more!</p>
    <p>From this clip, you can rewind, but I'm starting from <em>the scene</em>, so be warned.</p>

    <h2>Joel</h2>
    <p>Pedro Pascal <strong>is</strong> Joel. Wow, he is great here. He embodies Joel in so many ways, and he is a great adaptation of Joel. Can't wait to see more.</p>

    <h2>Ellie</h2>
    <p>Bella Ramsey <strong>is</strong> Ellie, YES! From her first scene, which is different from the game and it is just great. The way she has that bite (no pun intended) towards her captors is awesome!</p>

    <h2>Review Score</h2>
    <p>Without a doubt 5/5. Oh boy, I'm so excited for more! Be on the lookout for more episode reviews.</p>
