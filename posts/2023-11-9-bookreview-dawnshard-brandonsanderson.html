        <h2>Written Review</h2>
        <p>Well well well, that was a blast! 290 page Cosmere novella set in the Stormlight Archive with a few characters we’ve met before and now they’re some of my favorite characters! </p>
        
        <p>This story happens fast! And that was something I felt with (<a href="../posts/2022-11-8-bookreview-edgedancer-brandonsanderson.html">Edgedancer</a>), the other Stormlight Archive novella. Yes, it’s a short story, obviously, but I think I wanted more! I loved it! It was fun and exciting and very Cosmere magical. Just fun!</p>
        
        <p>Things are opening up in the world it seems. And I can’t wait to read more of the Cosmere! </p>
        
        <p>You might have never thought about how enjoyable it would be to have Rysn, now disabled without the use of her legs, and the Lopen, previously disabled, to interact together and it be this enjoyable. They’re great together! </p>
        
        <p>This is another ship on the ocean story, something I hadn’t read much before except I just read Tress of the Emerald Sea a few books ago, this was similar to that in its Cosmere sailing story. </p>
        
        <p>I’ll save the spoilers for the spoiler section, but I HIGHLY recommend this book - please DO NOT SKIP THIS! Great stuff here!</p>

            <h2>Emotional Impact 5</h2>
        <p>JUST PLAIN FUN! </p>
        
        <h2>Characters 5</h2>
        <p>This was something that was much needed for these characters, but also, just a great dive into these characters. Wow, I said this was much needed, but I only thought that after reading this story. It was great to see some of these characters interact. </p>
        
        <h2>Plot 4</h2>
        <p>This is sad for me, I wanted this story to be a full 5 stars, but the story didn't seemed rushed but it was just too quick. I just wanted more out of this story - I loved the page count because it was a quick read, but I just wanted a little more. Still a very, very enjoyable plot! Exciting ending.</p>
        
        <h2>Prose 4</h2>
        <p>Overall, I wasn't blown away by the prose in this story. There were a few times where there were words that were added to sentences by characters that I didn't think they'd actually say. Like Kaladin saying "literally", or Huio saying "why you're still single". Maybe it's just my thoughts about a fantasy world using modern language. Ah, just struck me as odd. </p>
        
        <h2>World-Building 5</h2>
        <p>Now this, this is something that seems like is going to be VERY IMPORTANT for the future of the cosmere! ALUMINUM! Whatever that means.</p>

            <h2>Recap</h2>
        <p>Rysn is now a Dawnshard! I'm a little sad we only got the name Dawnshard in the last three chapters, but still I'm incredibly excited for the implications of Rysn on the story. Also, Lopen and Huio has sworn the Third Ideal! Sleepless are everywhere and are trying to save the cosmere. Aluminum is here and can stop Shards. Chiri-Chiri needs to bond a mandra and is going to become HUGE! Navani is now Queen Navani of Urithiru. Navani is the "Mother of Machines" so the Sleepless call her. There is so much about fabrials and the intricusy of the cosmere magic. </p>
        
        <h2>Some Takeaways</h2>
        <p><strong>What is a Dawnshard? from 17th Shard (<a href="https://coppermind.net/wiki/Dawnshard" target="_blank">Dawnshard - The Coppermind - 17th Shard</a>)</strong></p>
    
        <p>The Dawnshards are the four primal Commands that Adonalsium used to create all things. Each Dawnshard grants separate abilities, as well as powers accessible via any Dawnshard, and can supercharge Invested Arts, allowing for acts of magic that transcend what is normally possible. They are Commands of immense power, and at least one has been secreted away to prevent unknown groups from ending the lives of billions. The knowledge of Dawnshards is somewhat esoteric, most who know of them either seek them as weapons, or flee as far as they can from the Dawnshards.</p>
        
        <p>Also, Adonalsium... is god for them.</p>
        
        <p><strong>What is a Sleepless? from 17th Shard (<a href="https://coppermind.net/wiki/Sleepless" target="_blank">Sleepless - The Coppermind - 17th Shard</a>)</strong></p>
        <p>The Sleepless, also known as Dysian Aimians,  are a sapient non-human race from an unknown planet in the cosmere.  Their bodies are made up of swarms of creatures called "hordelings" that are mentally linked.They refer to themselves as "Sleepless" because at least some part of the horde is always awake. Some of the Sleepless can be found on Roshar, and they once lived in the Silver Kingdom of Aimia.</p>
