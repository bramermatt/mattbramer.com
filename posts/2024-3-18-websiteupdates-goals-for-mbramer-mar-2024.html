        <h1>My Goals for MattBramer.Com</h1>
        <p>For a long time now, I have been wanting to <em>revamp</em> my personal website. You want to know my thoughts on something: go to my website. You want to catch up on my life: go to my website.</p>

        <p>For sometime now, I have been trying to find my niche when it comes to my website. I want a certain look and certain feel to work on my site and I still don't think I've found that. </p>

        <p>What you're seeing here is something that I've been wanting to implement for a long time. Something I'm calling a <strong>BUMP</strong>. As you read this, you'll read <em>for a long time</em>, or <em>some time</em>. Yes, I've been thinking about this for a while.</p>

        <p>Most of my days are spent loving my wife and kids, and working, and school work, and reading. I have an incredible life, and I am blessed beyond describing. With that said, I spend a lot of spare moments thinking about my website and looking at other websites and figuring out how their sites are setup and how to make my site look like theirs!</p>

        <p>So, with saying nothing, and saying something: things will be changing on my website. Constantly. I currently have no plan or roadmap for these updates, but as you check back on my site: be warned, it might look different every time you arrive.</p>

        <p><strong>My Goal</strong>, I will say, is so that you can see the newest content that I've posted, as well as, being able to follow each book series I'm reading and reviewing. Also, if you click on a video game review, you'd be able to go back one level to the Reviews sections.</p>

        <p>There is just a lot to do, and I'm still learning on how to do this all. I appreciate you all checking out my site.</p>

        <p>P.S. Sharing is something I want to work on too. These social media sites (of that there are so many) all don't have an unlimited character limit. My website does. So I'm also working on trying to figure out how to post my content on these sites at the same time they come to my site. We'll see how that all works out!</p>
