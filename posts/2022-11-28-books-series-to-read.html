<h2>I really love reading</h2>
<p>As you may know, I really love reading. And there are so many books and series in the world to read. I have a lot of books on my shelf to read, but let's talk about the full series that I eventually plan on reading!</p>

<h2>Series I'd Like To Read</h2>
<p>In no particular order.. As you can tell I'm really interested in Fantasy series. I just love being involved in these fantasy worlds! I feel I've missed so much by not reading for most of my life. And now I am getting the reading bug and having such a blast!</p>

<p>I may never get through all these series, but as of right now (November 2022), these are the series that I'd like to read. I'm going to try to give a brief synopsis of each of these series as I mention them.</p>

        <a href="https://amzn.to/3XDqtFG" target="_blank">Wheel of Time</a> by Robert Jordan and Brandon Sanderson.
        <p>A fifteen book series.</p>
        <p>The Wheel of Time is a series of high fantasy novels by American author Robert Jordan, with Brandon Sanderson as a co-author for the final three novels. Originally planned as a six-book series, The Wheel of Time spans 14 volumes, in addition to a prequel novel and two companion books. Jordan died in 2007 while working on what was planned to be the final volume in the series. He prepared extensive notes so another author could complete the book according to his wishes. Fellow fantasy author Brandon Sanderson was brought in to complete the final book. During the writing process, however, it was decided that the book would be far too large to be published in one volume; instead, it would be published as three volumes: The Gathering Storm (2009), Towers of Midnight (2010), and A Memory of Light (2013).</p>

        <p>A fourty-one book series.</p>
        <p>Discworld is a comic fantasy book series written by the English author Terry Pratchett, set on the Discworld, a flat planet balanced on the backs of four elephants which in turn stand on the back of a giant turtle. The series began in 1983 with The Colour of Magic and continued until the final novel The Shepherd's Crown, which was published in 2015, following Pratchett's death. The books frequently parody or take inspiration from classic works, usually fantasy or science fiction, as well as mythology, folklore and fairy tales, and often use them for satirical parallels with cultural, political and scientific issues.</p>

    <li>
        <a href="https://amzn.to/3OFzcmI" target="_blank">Mistborn</a> by Brandon Sanderson.
        <p>A seven book series.</p>
        <p>Mistborn is a series of epic fantasy novels written by American author Brandon Sanderson and published by Tor Books. The first trilogy, published between 2006 and 2008, consists of The Final Empire, The Well of Ascension, and The Hero of Ages. A second series was released between 2011 and 2022, and consists of The Alloy of Law, Shadows of Self, The Bands of Mourning and The Lost Metal. A third series will follow them, which is likely to be released yearly from 2025 to 2027. A fourth trilogy is also planned. Sanderson also released a novella in 2016, Mistborn: Secret History.</p>

        <p>The first Mistborn trilogy chronicles the efforts of a secret group of Allomancers who attempt to overthrow a dystopian empire and establish themselves in a world covered by ash. The first trilogy was a huge success and it pushed Sanderson to further develop his fictional universe, the Cosmere, which also includes The Stormlight Archive. Set about 300 years after the ending of the first trilogy, the second series is about the exploits of Waxillium Ladrian, a "wild-west Deputy" forced to move into the big city, and starts investigating kidnappings and robberies. The third series will be set in the early computer age with 1980s technology. The main character is planned as a Terris woman who is a computer programmer and Nicroburst; her brother is also planned to be a character. The fourth series is planned to be a space-opera.</p>

        <a href="https://amzn.to/3U8pJFH" target="_blank">Twilight</a> by Stephanie Myers.
        <p>A five book series.</p>

        <p>The Twilight Saga is a series of four vampire-themed fantasy romance novels, two companion novels, and one novella, written by American author Stephenie Meyer. Released annually from 2005 through 2008, the four books chart the later teen years of Isabella "Bella" Swan, a girl who moves to Forks, Washington, from Phoenix, Arizona and falls in love with a 104-year-old vampire named Edward Cullen. The series is told primarily from Bella's point of view, with the epilogue of Eclipse and Part II of Breaking Dawn being told from the viewpoint of character Jacob Black, a werewolf. The novel Midnight Sun is a retelling of the first book, Twilight, from Edward Cullen's point of view. The novella, The Short Second Life of Bree Tanner, which tells the story of a newborn vampire who appeared in Eclipse, was published on June 5, 2010, as a hardcover book and on June 7 as a free online ebook. The Twilight Saga: The Official Illustrated Guide, a definitive encyclopedic reference with nearly 100 full color illustrations, was released in bookstores on April 12, 2011. In 2015, she published a new book in honor of the 10th anniversary of the best-selling franchise, titled Life and Death: Twilight Reimagined, with the genders of the original protagonists switched.</p>

        <p>A four book series.</p>

Set in Middle-earth, intended to be Earth at some time in the distant past, the story began as a sequel to Tolkien's 1937 children's book The Hobbit, but eventually developed into a much larger work. Written in stages between 1937 and 1949, The Lord of the Rings is one of the best-selling books ever written, with over 150 million copies sold.</p>

        <a href="https://amzn.to/3gICXv6" target="_blank">The Witcher</a> by Andrzej Sapkowski.
        <p>A eight book series.</p>

        <p>The Witcher (Polish: Wiedźmin pronounced [ˈvʲɛd͡ʑmʲin]) is a series of six fantasy novels and 15 short stories written by Polish author Andrzej Sapkowski. The series revolves around the eponymous "witcher," Geralt of Rivia. In Sapkowski's works, "witchers" are beast hunters who develop supernatural abilities at a young age to battle wild beasts and monsters. The Witcher began with a titular 1986 short story that Sapkowski entered into a competition held by Fantastyka magazine, marking his debut as an author. Due to reader demand, Sapkowski wrote 14 more stories before starting a series of novels in 1994. Known as The Witcher Saga, he wrote one book a year until the fifth and final installment in 1999. A standalone prequel novel, Season of Storms, was published in 2013.</p>
