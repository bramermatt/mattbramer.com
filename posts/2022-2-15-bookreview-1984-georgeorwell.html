<h2 id="written">Written Review</h2>
<p>That was an infuriating mess of a book. 2/5. The more I read, the more I didn't want to read. I don't understand this book. And maybe that's my fault, maybe I “just don't get it”. But, by golly, this book was bad. Luckily I finished this in 4 days, but that's because I skipped about 40 pages, jumping through paragraphs, seeing if anything caught my attention. But no. I could go on, but I am onto the next book.</p>

<summary>Notes from my readings</summary>
    
<p>Oh man, this is hard to read. Like it's taking a lot out of me to read this book. I really don't want to stop reading this, to read another book, because I might not want to read this book when I come back to it.</p> 
    
<p>So, I'm going to continue to try to read 1984, and we'll see what happens.</p> 
    
<p>93. Hmm, at first I felt I was going to have to shelve this. But, reading more I found much more interest. I'm excited to keep reading.</p>
    
<p>148. Into Part Two now. We've met Julia and O'Brien has just invited us to his home. I feel as though this book could've been like 40 pages maybe? I only say that because of the author's, George Orwell, need for such clarification. He seems to harp, or spend a lot of time in great detail on each particular subject. Like page after page of description and detail and feeling, when the plot is only a paragraph or two. It's taken nearly half the book to get to an exciting point. And maybe that's my own fault for wanting this to be faster, maybe that's Orwell's writing style. Maybe I'm just wanting a tighter experience from my Orwellian Dystopian Past-Future story.</p>  
    
<p>200. I'm infuriated. Maybe that's not the right word. I just wish I would love this book. I'm finding it hard to love this book. As mentioned, Orwell is doubleplus detailed, to use some Newspeak. Page after page, on and on, again and again, over and over, everything goes; with little to know “meat”. No substance of any kind on most pages. I want to love this book. I'm about to start Part Three, and I feel as though this book could've been about half this size. Now I have 79 pages left, and we are at a bit of an exciting cliffhanger. And that's not what I've been known to expect with this book, so far. Let's see how this goes! I'm at around a 3/5 so far.</p>
