    <h2>Written Review</h2>
    <!-- <p>I will be updating this review shortly, I've finished reading and I'm excited to review this book!</p> -->
    <p>Oh, now this was a good book! Something that has been plaguing our characters for books.. has been resolved! This book also brought some unpredictable results. That was awesome! We had big character development and a great ending! </p>


    <h2>Spoilers Ahead</h2>
    <p>I am saying these <a href="#notes">Notes as I Read</a> are going to be spoilers if you've not read Winter's Heart yet! Please read at your own digression.</p>

    <details>
        <summary>Spoiler Story Breakdown</summary>
        <p>The taint.. CLEANSED! Cyndane is LANFEAR! Osan'gar is DASHIVA! </p>

        <p>Faile is gai’shain, Perrin is trying to find her with Masema and his crew. Elayne is staying her claim for the Lion Throne, and she was poisoned with Forkfroot but a darkfriend Daved Hanlon saved her. Turns out he is using his name as Doilin Mellar - Elayne asks Birgitte to make him Captain of her personal Bodyguard. </p>

        <p>Elayne and Aviendha are bonded as first-sisters in a really neat Aiel ceremony. Rand finally gets to talk to Elayne. Rand, Elayne, Min, and Aviendha all say they love each other. Great scene, Nynaeve is not having it lol. Then Aviendha, Elayne, and Min bond Rand. Then Elayne and Rand finally make love.</p> 

        <p>After spending a night with Elayne, Rand disappears with Nynaeve, the freed damane Alivia, and several ter’angreal. Including the ter’angreal that Rand gave Nynaeve, the two (we found out the name this book) access keys to Choedan Kal, the giant sa’angreal in Tremalking and Tremonsian. Their task was to cleanse saidin. We’ll come back to this.</p> 

        <p>Mat is alive! The Seanchan Return has started in Ebou Dar. The Daughter of the Nine Moons is here too! Her name is Tuon, and she is around people hiding who she really is - a veil that is covering…. something. While Tuon is wearing the veil she is just High Lady Tuon. Tylin is still being horrible to Mat. The gholam is back but Mat is saved by a man named Noal Charin, who I think has some connection to Jain Farstrider because their name was Jain Charin.. I think. May brings Noal back to the Tarasian Palace and turns out Tylin is entertaining Tuon and Suroth! Tuon offers to buy Mat. </p>

        <p>Mat needs to leave Ebou Dar, he starts having his Redarms move his belonging to an inn and finds Joline and agrees to help them leave Ebou Dar. </p>

        <p>Rand, Nynaeve, Lan, and Alivia are in Far Madding looking for the bad Asha’man. Turns out Far Madding has a sort of ter’angreal that generates a Stedding meaning no one can channel - which is important later! Rand kills two Asha’man but Padan Fain is there! Rand gets arrested and Cadsuane (oh yeah she’s there too!) and Nynaeve use ter’angreal Wells to show of their use of the Power even with the Stedding-like ter’angreal. </p>

        <p>Back to Mat, Bayle Domon and Egeanin are there - they gave that male a’dam to Suroth to save their own lives. Mat then frees the captured Aes Sedai and a Sea Folk Windfinder, Tylin lets Mat go - after he tied her up (she asked for it). Then Tuon tries to stop Mat and Noal helps Mat. Egeanin finds Mat and Tuon with Tuon tied up, saying “that’s the Daughter of the Nine Moons!” And Mat remembers what the Alefinn says, and then calls her his wife three times.</p> 

        <p>Back to Rand - Rand, Nynaeve, Cadsuane, and crew go to Shadar Logoth to cleanse saidin. Then the Forsaken come because they can feel that much Power being used. Rand and Nynaeve are using the access keys for the huge sa’angreal known at the Choedan Kal. The Forsaken are fended off by linked Aes Sedai and Asha’man! Osan’gar, who is Dashiva, is killed. Rand cleanses saidin, destroying Shadar Logoth and the female Choedan Kal.</p>

        <summary>Spoiler Review</summary>
    <p>This book was great! After nine books, it is hard to keep being unexpected.. but that keeps happening! I am so excited to see happens with the taint being cleansed - what does that mean for male channelers! And for female channelers for that matter! Will it be okay for men to channel now? Will everyone know the taint is cleansed? What does that mean for the madness? </p>

    <p>This book was not a SLOG. As many have called if, I do t know why it’s considered that? There were some chapters that just happened and there were some slow developments. But I think there were many more great chapters than slow chapters! And even a pretty short book too! SUCH A GOOD BOOK! </p>

    <p>How could I have guessed Taim was a darkfriend?? Or those Asha’man, that was completely unexpected. </p>

        <summary>Review Scores</summary>

<h2>Emotional Impact</h2>        
<p>I was yearning for the taint to be cleansed and I felt ;94 our characters struggles and I was happy! </p>

<h2>Characters</h2>
<p>Oh, RJ is doing some great work with his characters. </p>

<h2>Plot</h2>
<p>The taint being cleansed was a great ending! There were also some great character development! Mat is back! </p>

<h2>Prose</h2>
<p>Beautiful as always. I’m praising the prose specifically on the ending here, because for each WOT book the endings can sometimes be confusing, this was not that! </p>

<h2>World Building</h2>
<p>There are so many characters, and places, and factions, and communities. It’s really special. I haven’t seen much of religion, but maybe I’m just not looking hard enough. There is, of course, thank the Light and such. </p>

        <p>"The seals that hold back night shall weaken, and in the heart of winter shall winter's heart be born amid the wailing of lamentations and the gnashing of teeth, for winter's heart shall ride a black horse, and the name of it is Death. — from The Karaethon Cycle: The Prophecies of the Dragon"</p>
    
        <h2>Prologue</h2>
        <h2>Snow, Wheel and Snake</h2>
        <p><strong>Seaine.</strong>  A continuation from The Path of Daggers interegation scene with the Sitters. Gotta love these names.. Seaine, Saerin, Pevara, Yukiri, and Doesine are in the second basement of the White Tower. Seaine is using an eavesdropping weave to make sure they aren't disturbed. Saerin is in charge. They're questioning Talene with the Chair of Remore, a ter'angreal that recreates the consequences of one's crimes.. AWESOME! Talene cracks she forswears her Black Ajah oaths on the Oath Rod and literally has a seizure, then reswears the Three Oaths. And swears to obey the other five. Talene admits to being BA then says Elaida is BA. Not true! It's Alviarin! They all decide to keep this a secret and Pevara tells about Zerah, Bernaile, and the other eight moles from Salidar. They want them to swear oaths to this crew.. Neat! A fun start! Intrigue!</p>
    
        <p><strong>Elayne.</strong> Good gracious, this was a lot! I loved Dylin saying "is the whole world going to come in here".. hahah! Alright! Elayne is in the Royal Palace with Dylin and Birgitte. Birgitte is now Captain General of the Queen's Guards, awesome. The story is Birgitte is from Kandor. Nynaeve and Vandene aren't back yet. They are making arrangements with Reanne to rescue the Kin trapped in Seanchan territory. Vandene is trying to find Adeleas' killer. Birgitte is recruiting mercenaries, since armsmen from Elayne's estates aren't there yet. Dyline and Birgitte odn't get along. Some politics insune on who is siding with Elayne, turns out only a few. Birgitte says Gawyn will come, Elayne sent three couriers to TV with messages for him. Then two Sea Folk come in, Renaile din Calon and Zaida din Parede Blackwing, and Merlille. The SF are angry with Elayne for not providing more teachers - their bargain. Elayne suggests they go to Tear wtih the SF ships, but Zaida declines saying they are going to wait for Rand. Elayne and Zaida make a new bargain using Sareitha and Careane might be able to help. MORE MORE MORE. Reene Harfor (Elayne's First Maid - also Kinswomen), saying Taim is here. Taim enters.. this is so cool. Taim is portrayed as terrifying here, with two Asha'man. Whoa! Elayne links with Merilille and Renaile. Elayne wishes she had one of the thre angreal from ED. Zaida and Birgitte draw their knives. Taim tells Elayne that Rand sent her a gift from the south, and Taim will deliver later. Elayne demands that Taim let her guards into the BT. Taim agrees but with escorts. Elayne says they will come everyday and she will come too. THEN THEN THEN. Nadere comes and summons Elayne to her first-sister ceremony with Avi. THIS WAS AWESOME! Elayne was told to strip right there and it was awesome to see the women protect Elayne from those stinky men.. lol. Nadere takes her to a room with a dozen WOs and Avi. Amys, Tamela, Viendre, Monaelle, and Shyanda. Tamela and Viendre are stronger in the OP than Elayne, but Monaelle is in charge. Amys must've Travelled from Cairhien - Egwene taugh the WOs for them teaching her lessons about TAR. Elayne wishes Melaine were here but Monaelle tells them that channeling involved would be a risk to her babies. Elayne asks about the bond with Birgitte and Monaelele respons with "probs not". No, she says she might feel a little. The ceremony insues and Elayne and Avi are given to each other by surrogate mothers and they must name the most and least favorite things about each other, then a slap fight, then they hug. The WOs channel and something like a Warder bond forms between Elayne and Avi - they are first-sisters. WHOA! THIS WAS AWESOME!</p>
    
        <p><strong>Toveine.</strong> The Aes Sedai Logain bonded in TPOD. Sweet! Glad we get this perspective! There are 51 captive Aes Sedai in the BT now, including Akoure, Desandre, Jenare, Lemai, Carniele, and Ayako. They all blame Toveine for their perdicament. The Asha'man are building a perimeter wall around a four square mile area - there are now about 500 Asha'man! WOW! Toveine sees five Asha'man escorting a dozen Andoran Queen's Guards and Elayne and Birgitte! That was fast! The Asha'man, whose name we don't know, is bulky-middle years with oily hair, an oily smile, augur-like eyes, and an Illianer accent. Toveine feels Logain's pull and goes to his house. Gabrelle, the other AS he bonded, spent the night with him ;). There are several Dedicated waiting on Logain, Evin Vinchova, Donalo Sandomere, Androl Genhald, Mezar Kurin, and Canler. Vinchova reports that the Tow Rivers men are a problem, two are fourteen (THE PRICKLY BUSH THAT TAIM WAS TALKING AOBUT!) Donalo reports that Mishraile is receiving private lessons from Taim.. hmm. Welyn Kajima, Dedicated, runs up that Taim is back from Cairhien and posted new deserters, seven full Asha'man: Gedwyn, Torval, Rochaid, Kisman, Dashiva, Flinn, Hopwil, and Narishma. Logain tels Toveine and Gabrelle to go inside and he heads off with the Dedicated. Gabrelle says she's learned that all the full AM but Logain live in Taim's palace. Logain found Toveine's orders and burned them. One order was Elaida's to gentle and hang every man found. Gabrelle convices Toveine the captured AS must put their differences aside and stand united. Desandre and Lemai have the highest standing. Toveine agrees to submit. </p>
    
        <p><strong>Rand.</strong> WHOA! Let's go. Rand is in the City in Cairhien. People are working to clear rubble around the Sun Palace. Rand is back in the city at the Acadamy - this is awesome! Min, Dobraine, and Idrien are here. Rand can feel Alanna sulking. Min wanted to get some of Herid Fel's books. Dobraine tells Rand that some people think he is dead or kidnapped again. People think the attack was Forsaken or Aes Sedai. Dobraine tells Rand that Flinn, Narishma, and Hopwil are still in the Sun Palace. Ailil and Shalon have *disappeared* lol Rand trapped them under the beds. Rand told Dobraine that Cadsuane is probably holding them like she is holding Caraline Damodred and Darlin Sisnera. In the courtyard below, Mervin Poel's steamwagon beings moving under its own power and Rand is shocked! Idrien tells Rand about the other accomplishments at the school. Kin Tovere has finished his telescope, Maryl Harke has built a glider, Jander Parentakis has built a riverboat with waterwheels, Ryn Anhara has built a lightning jar, and there is mention of Niko Tokama. LTT mumbles to Rand and says "I thought I could build, I was wrong. We are not builders, not you, or I, or the other one. We are destroyers" WHAT?! WHO?! THE OTHER ONE?! HMMMM. Anyway, Rand has decided who will rule Cairhien and Tear, Rand gives Dobraine two packets - one for instructions for Dobraine as a steward for Cairhien. He also tells Dobraine to push for Elayne when she claims the Sun Throne. And he tells Dobraine to deliver the second packet when it is appropriate. Rand has a third packet in his pocket for Gregoin as steward of Illian. Dobraine and Idrien leave and Rand gets dizzy. He is used to them when channeling but this is the first time without saidin. Rand then opens a gateway to a clearing 500 miles away from Cairien, closer to TV. Yesterday Rand Traveled to Rhuidean where Rand asked about Shara, then Traveled to Tear and Rand asked about Chachin. He is trying to keep people off his real track. Rand has a bag with him that still has two ter'angreal (has to be those statues), but only Rand can use the male statue.. so maybe Nynaeve but that's difficult because he doesn't know where she is.. hmm. Then Rand tells Min that he plans to cleanse the taint on saidin! But first, he must kill Dashiva and the others...... WOW. I FEEL LIKE WE ARE SO CLOSE TO THIS!</p>

        <h2>Ch 1, Leaving the Prophet, Wolf</h2>
        <p><strong>Perrin.</strong> Perrin, Elyas, Grady, Aram, Seonid, Masuri and the two Wise Ones leave their meeting with Masema in his house in Abila. Colors swirl around in Perrin's head when he thinks of Rand... what is going on? That happens to Rand, but I don't think it is connected to when Rand is thinking of Perrin. But I'll have to go back to be sure. Perrin is furious with Masema insisting they travel by horse and not by Traveling. Masema has agreed to bring at least a hundred of his men. Neald and three Ward are there too. Balwer shows up and reports that King Ailron and the army of Amadicia were defeated by the Seanchan ten days ago at the town of Jeramel a hundred miles west. Valda and the Whitecloaks - the Seanchan lost a major battle and were driven back to ED. Perrin sees a hawk and thinks about Faile and how much he loves her... oh boy. He's about to get a rude awakening.</p>

        <h2>Ch 2, Taken, Wheel and Snake</h2>
        <p><strong>Perrin.</strong> Perrin rides Stayer as he and the others find the camp, and it's a mess! The Mayeners are in a standoff with the Ghealdanin. Berelain, Gallenne, and Annoura face Alliandre's First Captain Gerard Arganda. Berelain tells Perrin that Faile and Alliandre were captured by some Aiel. Perrin thinks this whole situation came from Rand's orders... yes, yes they did. Elyas and Berelain tell Perrin to remain calm. Elyas and Aram head southeast to scout. The three Warder follow. Grady and Neald keep watch and Balwer listens intently. Perrin calls to the wolves and finds Three Toes, Cold Water, Twilight, and Springhorn. There are a lot of two-legs around so the wolves can't help. They tell Perrin to give up and move on. Gerard Arganda threatens to put the Aiel with Perrin to question. Perrin goes OFF! Berelain tries to touch Perrin and he storms off with Gallenne. Perrin sees the four WOs who stayed behind. Gaul and the Maidens are there. Dannil Lewin tells Perrin he sent Jondyn Barran, Hu Marwin, and Get Ayliah to scout. Perrin asks Gaul to find Faile. Gaul LEADS SUILIN AND THE MAIDENS - that's awesome! Perrin realizes Bain and Chiad are with Faile. Perrin tells Grady and Neald to go get packed. Perrin asks Nevarin abou how the Aiel will treat Faile, she doens't know and tells Perrin to calm down. Perrin goes back to his tent and wonders where Masema is - also he thinks the WOs are plotting to kill Masema. Balwer has disappeared again. Basel Gill runs away from Perrin. Lini tells Perrin to take care of himself and confirms Maighdin is with Faile. Perrin promises to get them all back. Perrin and Tallanvor keep watch, they don't speak but they watch the moon rise together... aw lol</p> 

        <h2>Ch 3, Customs, HAWK</h2>
        <p><strong>Faile.</strong> I tell you what, this seems like this is giong to be a long drawn out process with these Shaido and Faile.. lol. Aiel and Faile. SO! The Shaido force Faile and the other captives to marhc through the snow naked. Rolan leads Faile. Faile is lifted up out of the snow and everyone else is - frost bite is the worst. Bain and Chiad will be gai'shain. Faile falls asleep and dreams of Perrin chasing her. She wakes up and a gai'shain gives her honey and tea. The gai'shain tells her she was shamed.. the Mera'din wrapped them in coats when they should have been left bare. Efalin should have known better. There are THOUSANDS of Shaido and Faile can't think of a way out..</p>

        <h2>Ch 4, Offers, Aiel</h2>
        <p><strong>Faile.</strong> This took a bit to get through. Small things kept happening, and I was expecting more really lol. So: Therava and Someryn arrive and dismiss Rolan and other Shaido. Someryn says they have more gai'shain for Sevanna. Alliandre announces who she is and that her liege lady is Faile. Sevanna is wearing wetlander clothes. Galina is here and says "yes" Alliandre is her. Faile knows Sevanna is responsible for Couladin and wants to hurt Sevanna for hurting Perrin. Sevanna' orders Galina to Heal the captives and Faile is amazed she is Aes Sedai. Sevanna announces that a fifth sept, the Jonine, has joined them. Therava says there are still 78 other septs. Clothes, food, and jewelry are given to this crew. Faile is seperated from Bain, Chiad, Lacile, and Arrela. There tells Faile and crew they will be gai'shain until they are old. Therava asks to spy on Sevanna. Galina comes and says "she's on an important mission from the WT." Faile tells Galina who she is and Sevanna has plans for Rand. Galina will keep her secret if they get a smooth white rod from Therava's tent, Faile desperately tries to think of a plan to escape. </p>

        <h2>Ch 5, Flags, Wolf</h2>
        <p><strong>Perrin.</strong> The Wolf Dream! We only know a little about this right? My assumption is this is TAR, but it's been some time since we've gottne some explanation. Perrin is a wolf in the Wolf Dream and is searching for Faile, Hopper confronts him and tells him he is in the dream too strongly and to leave or he will die. Faile is not there, Perrin tries to attack Hopper and then wakes up. Perrin wakes up in Berelain's tent without clothes. She tells him the missing people haven't been found and her scouts were dead. Galleene is trying to keep the camp secure, Arganda is sending out scouts despite her orders. Lini took Tallanvor back to his tent, but Perrin was nearly frozen. Annoura Healed Perrin, she said "he feltcold as though he had no soul", whatever that means. Perrin demands food and his clothes.. a few steps away from his bed. Perrin hopes Gaul or Jondyn find Faile. Berelain returns and offers Perrin a truce and Perrin doesn't understand and Berelain becomes angry. Berelain tells Perrin the Prophet has arrived with three or four hundred men - and she tells him Masema has been meeting with Seanchan. She also tells him her men were killed with crossbows and axes, not Aiel. Rosene enteres to bring food, but Berelain tells him that he would only be the third man to share her bed. Perrin leaves to find Masema. Masema's men are to the SW. Perrin notes the camps are packed and ready to move, Grady is by a fire. Perrin had planned to use the Wolfshead banner and Manetheren banner to disguise his mission but with so many of the Prophet's men that isn't possible.</p>

        <h2>Ch 6, The Scent of Madness, Falcon</h2>
        <p>Perrin. And just as I was down, I'M UP! This book is now picking up. I'm glad Masema and crew are coming with Perrin. THIS IS GOING TO BE BIG. There are SO MANY SHAIDO! Perrin is on Stepper, Perrin learns that Faile is alive from Sulin and Miadens and Warders. The Aiel are heading south Jondyn and Elyas are folling. There are arrows collected, half are Saido and the other half are from other clans. Sulin adds they saw Seanchan in the sky three times. Perrin feels he's caught in a blacksmith's puzzle.. ah that's cool! Perrin announces they will Travel forty miles to the south. He sends Neald to find Elyas and crew. Masema tells Perrin that all the Dragonsworn insisted on coming. Some think Perrin is Shadowspawn because of his eyes. I HADN'T THOUGHT ABOUT DARKFRIEND WOLF BROTHERS?! Perrin tells Masema to head east and that Perrin is going to find his wife, kidnapped by Aiel. Masema is surprised the rumors of Aiel are true and insists on coming along. He aggrees to Travel this one time and Perrin smells nothing but madness in him. Oh boy.</p>

        <h2>Ch 7, The Streets of Caemlyn, Lion</h2>
        <p><strong>Elayne.</strong> I am wanting more out of these Elayne perspectives lol. Elayne is going through the streets of Caemlyn on Fireheart (new horse) with Sareitha, her Warder Ned Yarman and eight Queen's Guards including Caseille, Deni, and Tzigan. Birgitte mainly recruits women. Elayne can feel Avi due to their new Sister-bond. Sareitha says the streets aren't safe. There are ten AS staying at The Silver Swan and they might be Elaida's - three more arrived and two left a few days ago. None are Red. Halwin Norry gave Elayne excellent info on the city, but Elayne wanted to go out for herself. Birgitte is coming and upset. They head back to the Palace and Birgitte meets them with news. While Naean and Elenia (who?).. (oh Andoran nobles) were being moved from Aringill to Caemlyn their guards were killed and they were freed. This means there is a spy in the Royal Palace. Reene Harfor intends to question every servent. Elayne thinks that if Jarid Sarand took them then House Arawn, Naean, will stand for House Sarand. Houses Anshar and Baryn will then join them. If Naean's people took them then Jarid will try to rescue Elenia. At the RP, Careane and one of her Warder Venr Kosaan are leaving. Sareitha and her Warder head to the library. Birgitte leaves then Elayne sends for Reene Harfor to meet her. yep.</p> 


        <h2>Ch 8, Sea Folk and Kin, A'dam</h2>
        <p><strong>Elayne.</strong> RJ, my guy, why did you have to name Reene and Reanne? Considering they're both named in this chapter with different interactions with Elayne?! Difficult to follow! So, Elayne wonders about spies. The First Maid outlines Elayne's schedule for the rest of the day including Halwin Norry about something urgent. He kept Caemlyn running since Rahvin took over. Some Kin are walking a sul'dam with an a'dam WHOA! The servants quarters are bursting with Kin and Sea Folk! Vandene comes up with Kirstian and Zarya (Kin - really old) who are now in novice white. Kirstian and Zarya have given suspects for Ispan's and Adeleas' murder… It should be none of their business. They reasoned out that it must have been Merilille, Sareitha or Careane. Elayne and Vandene are convinced that it was not one of the Kin. There are no Darkfriends among the Kin, else Ispan would have known much more about them than she did. I don't know that about the Kin. I imagine there might be a few Darkfriends among the THOUSANDS OF KIN?! DARKFRIENDS ARE EVERYWHERE!</p> 

        <p>Then Nynaeve and Lan show up, they're cute together. She has started wearing a ki'sain. Nynaeve has her hands full with the Kin, even with Alise helping, and now the Windfinders want lessons from her. Nynaeve pressures Vandene into taking charge of Kirstian and Zarya. Vandene acquiesces, but she says she only taught novices a short time because the Mistress of Novices, Sereille Bagand, thought she was too harsh! WHOA! </p>

        <p>Nynaeve then takes Elayne to Reanne. Nynaeve has sent eighteen of the Kin into Seanchan held territory to find and rescue any of the Kin there. They do not see how Egwene will realize her plan of incorporating the Kin into the White Tower. They find Reanne with Alise Tenjile and one of the sul'dam, Marli. Rand sent twenty-nine captured sul'dam and five damane. Alise says the sul'dam nearly have the spark to channel. Elayne intends to convince the sul'dam that they can channel, then send them back to the Seanchan. She hopes this will break the Seanchan power structure.</p>

        <p>Reanne says that three of the five damane, Marille, Jillari, Alivia, Kara and Lemore, are ready to be let out of their collars. Marille and Jillari still believe they must be collared, but Alivia says she hates sul'dam. She was collared when she was thirteen or fourteen and is now over four hundred years old. She is also stronger than Nynaeve. The other two who are ready are Kara who was a village wise woman on Toman Head and Lemore who was a Tanchico noble. They agree that the last three must be freed of their collars. </p>

        <p>A lot happened this chapter. WHOA!! </p>

        <h2>Ch 9, A Cup of Tea, Forsnaken</h2>
        <p><strong>Elayne.</strong> Well hello forkroot tea, you do be minty. Alright let's go! Elayne is in her rooms with her maid Essande to help her change out of her riding clothes. Elayne is going to go meet with merchants with Birgitte. She can sense Birgitte is frusted with her paperwork. Halwin Norry (First Clerk) is waiting for her in her sitting room and reports that there are large deposits of alum(inum) being discovered on her estates at Danabar. That will make the bankers more amenable to lending money even though Danabar is some distance from the Lugard Road. Elayne is delighted. She wants to fund the Academy of the Rose - Rand started another school in Caemlyn and Elayne has taken it over in memory of Morgase. Norry tells her about Elaida's proclamation regarding Rand. It was Alviarin.. um actually Elayne. Norry also tells Elayne about the Sun Palace attack from the OP - a week ago and Rand disappeared. The Blight is unusally quiet and the rulers of the Borderlands seem to be unavailable (PROLOGUE TPOD!!) King Roedran is raising an army in Lugard, Elayne knows this from Egwene. Norry tells her she has support from the ST in Cairhien. She tells him to write letters to the major Houses as she is stating her claim on the ST as daughter of Taringail Damodred, she will claim it when things are settled in Caemlyn. Norry leaves and three *maids* bring her lunch then Dyelin comes in with news of an army in Braem Wood. A reliable Illianer merchant named Tormon brought the news from New Braem. There are thousands of Arafellin, Kandori, and Shienarans - Elayne things they must be there because of Rand - they want to attack Rand!! As Elayne drinks her... forkroot tea, she feels woozy and realizes it is forkroot. She tries to send a feeling of panic to Birgitte and tells Dyelin she's been poisoned. Three servants come in and draw knives. Dyelin screams murder and attacks them and one man slashes Dyelin. As Elayne is passing out, Elayne sees two of the men are now dead and the third is struggling with an axe-faced guardsman who came to her rescue. I'm trying to remember but is this axe-face the man.. let me read.. brb..... Daved Hanlon? That's no good.</p>

        <h2>Ch 10, A Plan Succeeds, TAR</h2>
        <p><strong>Elayne.</strong> Well that wasn't much worry now was it? Elayne is awake and safe all thanks to someone named Doilin Mellar a Guardsman. Avi, Birgitte, and Nynaeve are with her and it's night, Nynaeve Healed Dyelin. Nynaeve gave Elayne herbs to overcome the forkroot. Elayne thinks Dyelin proved her loyalty. Avi isn't around as much because Melaine and WOs have her back in training. Birgitte shows Elayne a knife they recovered - Nynaeve said it had deadly poison on it. They think it was a complicated plan and Elayne agrees to having some bodyguards with Mellar at the head. He fought for Morgase during the Succsession. Elayne drinks a glass of wine and goes to sleep to enter TAR with Nynaeve. They're in the Grand Hall of the RP, Nynaeve using the twisted ring is misty. Eg tells about the days events. The Sitters don't want to accept new novices because there are only 16 Accepted to train them. Eg wants Nynaeve to meet Sharina Melloy (NYNAEVE'S ACCEPTED TEST!) Eg now intends to keep using the Oath Rod and require the Three Oaths, Nynaeve and El disagree. The eldest of the Kin, Aloisia Nemosni is nearly 600 years old! She might die if she swears, but Eg is adamant. She spells out her plan for the Kin, they keep their ways but are tied to the WT and subservient to the Amyrlin. All sisters must swear on the OR. But if they want to retire they can and may be released from their oaths and join the Kin.. woo! But they must give up their title as AS. Nynaeve asks about Eg's headaches and she says Halima is good at massages lol. THEN they see a man standing by the door.... LORD LUC / SLAYER?! A man that looks like he could be Rand's Uncle! He runs away, they hear a door clicking shut at the opposite end of the room. El tells Eg about the Borderlands, Eg is irritated they must be after Rand, El is pleased and now knows how to use them to secure the Lion Throne! WHOA! COULD IT BE LUC??</p>

        <p><strong>Asne.</strong> Whoa! Asne and Chesmal (WORLD'S BEST HEALER besides Nynaeve..) are in Caemlyn. Asne avoids conversation with Chesmal beacuse she's annoying - she is bragging about questioning Tamra and how she told the Reds to murder Sierin Vayu. Names... Eldrith returns and Chesmal is angry she is late. Eldrith is in charge though, on Mogi's orders. They all remained in Samara even after the Prophet moved into Amadicia, then they fled Eldrith's Warder Kennit after he tried to hill her. They decided on Caemlyn in hopes that Elayne and Nyaeve would come there. Temaile enters wearing a glass bracelet ter'angreal. Eldrith is annoyed. They agreed not to visit TAR because they think Ny bested Mogi there. Temaile reports Ny and El are in the RP. They call them wilders and they think there are only three AS in the RP. She adds there are others spying on the two Accepted, a man they saw and someone else (this is in TAR)... I THINK IS SLAYER!! the other person they couldn't see... I DON'T KNOW! Asne thinks to herself that she is glad her for Warder are nearing Caemlyn, she stopped masking herself when they left Samara. Powl is the only Darkfriend among them... A DARKFRIEND WARDER! That makes sense, you don't have to be anyone special to be a Warder. And then Temaile still has the balefire fluted black rod from Mogi. Whoa!</p>

        <p><strong>Mili Skane.</strong> OH NOO! So I was right baout Murellin being Daved Hanlon, woo! Mili Skane now thinks of herself as Lady Shiaine Avarhin - with a beautiful told backstory by RJ.. wow. The Heart and Hand is the sigil of the House Avarhin. Falion serves are her maid, satifying Moridin's punishment. Shiaine thinks her failure is buried.. On Moridin's orders through Mogi, Marillin also reports to Shiaine. Marillin tells Shiaine she can't do what she wants. There are too many channelers in the RP, however there is a woman in the RP who can do what Shiaine wants. Shiaine thinks that must mean BA! Then Hanlon enters announcing himself the Captain of the Queen's Bodyguard. uh oh. </p>

        <h2>Ch 11, Ideas of Importance, Sea Folk (what a cool tattoo idea btw)</h2>
        <p><strong>Rand.</strong> Rand opens a gateway in an attic in the RP.. I CAN'T WAIT FOR THIS MEETING! Min is there. Saidin makes Rand sick and LTT begs him to let go. Min has a sneezing attack from the dust. Rand is disguised using the Mask of Mirrors. Min wants Rand to see El and Avi but he refuses. Rand wants to find Nynaeve and Mat, then leave. They go down the stairs and run into Reene Harfor, Min tells her that "Nuli" has somethign for Nynaeve and it must be delivered immediately. They are surprised to learn that Mat isn't there. When Rand thinks of Mat he gets colors blurring his mind and thinks he sees Mat's face... interesting. Rand can tell there are lots of women channling even though the First Maid tells him there are only five AS there. Rand wonders about the rumors of hundreds of AS heading to Caemlyn with an army. </p>

        <p><strong>Nynaeve.</strong> I'm pumped! Nynaeve is giving a lesson to Talaan while Zaida and six Windfinders look on. ... Talaan eventually shields Nynaeve and Nynaeve tries to break it (finding a soft spot) but can't. Nynaeve runs into Alivia (seanchan) who says Reanne Corly wants Nynaeve to join her for dinner. Talaan catches up with her and asks to go to the WT to train. Lan and Nynaeve go to her room - Rand is there and gives Nynaeve the woman statue ter'angreal for the sa'angreal! Also, Nynaeve tried to Delve Rand and stepped back after she felt a ward of saidin. Rand wants to cleanse saidin and Nynaeve is excited! Nynaeve agrees but only if she and Lan go with Rand now! I'M SO EXCITED. I still love Nynaeve and want her to be happy. That is all - reading on!</p>

        <h2>Ch 12, A Lily in Winter, Dragon</h2>
        <p><strong>Elayne.</strong> Elayne, Min, Avi, and Rand love each other and Rand has now been bonded by the three - INCREDIBLE! Beautifully written and described.. wow. Min is with Avi and Elayne and Elayne's bodyguards, they enter Nynaeve's room and Rand is there. They all profess their love for each other and Nynaeve is not having it lol. Rand tells them not to trust any Asha'man except Flinn, Narishma, and Hopwil - I am inclined to believe Rand here. Rand also apologizes for the sul'dam and damane. Rand still thinks Mat is with Eg but they don't tell him otherwise. Rand wants to leave immediately but they all convice him to stay... ;). Rand disguises himself as Nuli and goes to Elayne's room - they ask to bond him as Warder. He tells them about Alanna and Elayne says that doesn't ward him against being bonded to more than one AS. He agrees and Elayne and Avi link and weave Spirit around the three women and lay the weave on Rand. All Three women can now feel Rand's pain and his love. Rand goes to leave but Elayne says there is just.. one more thing. Min and Avi leave and Elayne asks Rand to help take her dress off..... bow-chicki-wow-wow... hahahaha this is awesome. </p>

        <p><strong>Min.</strong> I love a good Min viewing. Also, I have absolutely no idea what is going to happen to all of these people being bonded together. I literally have zero idea what to expect and I love that. After eight WOT books, its hard not to see some things coming and that's why I love the unexpected. This: unexpected. Let's talk about some Viewings! Min sees that Elayne will have children from this experience with Rand a boy and a girl - healthy and strong, so will Avi - FOUR! Something was odd about having four children at once, healthy but odd. Min and Avi see Birgitte, and Min recognizes her as Birgitte Silverbow from Falme! Min can't get block the feeling of Rand out of her head, Avi can, Birgitte can't either (right? I read that right, Birg can't block it?) - then they all get drunk.</p>

        <p><strong>Elayne.</strong> Rand you sly dog - into the next morning too ;) lol. Elayne wakes up to find Rand gone and he left her a present of a golden lily in full bloom (in the winter Rand... how??) Elayne weaves a Keeping around it and it will stay fresh forever. Mogi taught her that. As the Joker says... and.. here.. we.. go... Alivia, Nynaeve, and Lan left in the night. The Kin, Zaida, and the Windfinders are in a tizzy. The most perful angreal and some ter'angreal from the ED stash have been taken. Whoa!</p>

        <h2>Ch 13, Wonderful News, Cairhien Sun</h2>
        <p><strong>Cadsuane.</strong> I'm really interested in what Cadsuane's got going on - she is a force! Cadsuane is in the SP with Harin and her Sailmistress Derah and they are meeting with her demanding the return of Shalon. Cadsuane is annoyed with the Sea Folk. A lot of people are there - Daigian, Eben, Nesuane, Sarene, Erian, Beldeine, Elza, Verin, and Sorilea. Verin has her flower brooch (angreal, right?) and Sorilea gives Verin a vial and tells her it will help her sleep but not too much because it can kill! Cadsuane shuts down Harine and tells Sarene to take the SF back to their rooms. Sorilea reporst 19 prisoners, Chisaine, Nurbaya, Janine, Innina, and Vayelle swore to Rand last night. Cadsuane is sus. Cadsuane once tried to root out the BA (failed!). She also failed about learning about Moiraine and Siuan. oh Moiraine we miss you (SHE WILL BE BACK!). Sorilea goes to the fireplace to lecture the four sisters there. Verin tells Cadsuane that Bera and Kiruna got nowhere questioning Shalon and Ailil, so Verin gave it a try. They were just covering up the fact that they were pillow friends which would cause both of them great embarrassment. Cadsuane tells Verin to let them go, but to have Ailil report on Toram Riatin and Shalon report on the Sea Folk. Cadsuane has already blackmailed the three Asha'man. Corele enters and says Damer Flinn Healed Irgain!! A MAN HEALING A WOMAN STILLED?! WOW! Do we trust Flinn, we have to right? Rand does. Flinn wants to try to Heal Ronaille and Sashalle - Rand stilled them. Irgain is ready to swear to Rand. Cadsuane began gathering sisters she trusted as soon as she heard about the strange events in Shienar - she also had e-a-e watching Siuan and Moiraine for YEARS! More... Jahar comes in and says Alanna is uncoscious. Corele, Sorilea, and Verin follow. Dobraine comes up and says Caraline and Darlin left Arilyn's place on their way to Tear where Darlin will be Rand's steward. No Healing works as she's not hurt but Alanna is just scared and Verrin looks terrified. They wait.</p> 

        <p><strong>Demandred.</strong> WHO IS CYNDANE?! I know (my guess is) Moridin is Ishamael, Rj basically told us this chapter.. he thinks he's the DO himself. ISHAMAEL! I can't wait for that reveal. SO: Demandred is meeting with Graendal, Osan'gar, and Aran'gar - nice, glad the transmigration is out there. Semirhage has a hard time getting to the meetings (she's in shayol ghul right?), and they wonder why Mesaana is missing (she's in the WT). Dem has a thought abuot view-walls, shocklances, and sho-wings no longer being made outside this place near Shayol Ghul - that would be a vacuole right? Dem is furious that Rand is no where to be found even though he's been seen everywhere and the attempt on Rand's life was filed. Osan frowns when Dem calls the failure Asha'man fools and idiots... OH OSAN'GAR ARE YOU AN ASHA'MAN?! Aran'gar says that Osan'gar and Demandred are responsible for wathcing Rand... is DANI RIGHT ABOUT DEMANDRED BEING TAIM?! WOW! that's not confirmed just seems like it. Aran' says her charge is under control.. cough, Egwene. Graendal says Aran' and the men should be worried if Rand succeeds - Osan' thinks Rand can't possible remove the taint. Graendal says that if Rand succeeds the DO won't trust those who channel saidin... oh that's interesting! Dem notes she is wearing a simple gold ring. During the War of the Shadow more than a dozen of the Chosen died because of the DO's suscpicion. </p>

        <p>Moridin comes in with Cyndane and says the DO knows they are all loyal. Moridin comments that Isam is still supposed to find and kill Fain - I've completely forgotten about Isam!! He was the one who sent the Trollocs to the Two Rivers, or at least that's what the Trollocs shouted "ISAM!". Moridin vaporizes the rat with the True POWER.. nice. He is Nae'blis and only Moridin has access to the True Power. Cyndane announces Rand has two of the "access keys" and intends to use the Choedan Kal. Dem thinks Graendal's reaction is fake - Dem thinks Cyndane is Lanfear until Mesaana told him she was weaker than Lanfear. Moridin says theywill all know when Rand starts to use the Choedan Kal, he orders them to take him or kill him if neccessary. This is going to be good!</p> 


        <h2>Ch 14, What a Veil Hides, Seanchan</h2>
        <p><strong>Tuon.</strong> THE DAUGHTER OF THE NINE MOONS!! BOOM! MIC DROP! Oh wow, this chapter brings into perspective just how BIG this story is. Wow. I love this so much! This was an incredible introduction to this character we've heard so little about... so goooooood! AHHHHH!</p>

        <p>Alright - Tuon is in her cabin in the Victory of Kidron. Selucia, Tuon's so'jhin and chief maid, shaves her head then dresses her. In secret, Selucia is also a trained fighter and her bodyguiard. Tuon keeps eyes on omens, first is an albatross, an omen of victory. Omens are the same whether in Imfaral or Noren M'Shar (wherever that is). Selucia was a cradle-gift for Tuon. Tuon wishes she were more impressive, two of her siblings are dead and two more disgraced and made da'covale. Anath is Tuon's Soe'feia or Truthspeaker. Her previous, Neferi, died in a fall two years ago. For some reason, the Empress named Anath instead of Neferi's planned successor. OH BOY IS THE EMPRESS A DARKFRIEND?!?! DARKFRIENDS EVERYWHERE! </p>

        <p>Tuon asks for a veil instead of her lace cap. This marks her as just one of the Blood and not the Daughter of the Nine Moons - she decides on the veil because she feels bad for ordering a damane beaten last night after they told the future... Tuon almost feels sei'mosiev and must make amends to restore sei'taer. Tuon goes to the second cabin where six of her damane and their sul'dam await. She tells Ianelle to give treats to Lidya, the damane she had beaten. She ordered Lidya to toell her futture and didn't like what she heard. The other damane are Dali, Dani, Charral, Sera, and Mylen (AS). Tuon bought her at Shon Kifar and trained her herself, she was especially difficult and nearly died. Catrona neow holds her leash. Tuon leaves her cabins and Musenge, captain of the Deathwatch Guards, notes her veil and assigns only two guards. Deathwatch Guard armor is lacquered blood read and nearly black green. There are a dozen Ogier GARDENERS STANDING GUARD! Yuril, her secretary bows, he is also her Hand and in charge of her Seekers - Ronde Macura prostrates herself (I love that word). In Tanchico she begged to be taken into service and provides lots of info on AS she hates. </p>

        <p>Tuon goes to the quaterdeck where Captain Tehan and Anath are. Anath chides Tuon for wearing the veil over a little thing like a beating. She continues berating Tuon. Tuon recalls that Algwyn, the last man to sit on the Crystal Throne almost a thousand years ago, let his Soe'feia get away with slapping him in public. Tuon tells ANath that she doesn't need a penance. Anath's last penance left Tuon crying for days. Tuon says that Suroth is to be commended for her success but to be watched for her ambition. Anath says she is sure Suroth is loyal... DARKFRIEND! I TELL YA! Tuon says they must make contact with Rand so that he can kneel before the CT before The LB according to the Prophecies of the Dragon. Anath is pleased and tells Tuon to be careful not to let him learn how dangerous she is to him. They approach the harbor of ED!</p>

        <h2>Ch 15, In Need of a Bellfounder, Dice</h2>
        <p><strong>Mat.</strong> And just like that.. Mat is alive! He is with Aludra in her wagon in Valan Luca's circus trying to convince her to tell him more about her fireworks! What a sentance lol. Mat says the Illuminator's Guild House in Tanchico was destroyed by the SC and the Illuminators were made da'covale. She will tell him her secrets if he can figure out why she is interested in a bellfounder - bell maker. Mat leaves and Aludra comments about Mat's clothes - Tylin got ride of his old clothes while he was in bed with a broken leg and ribs. All he was left with was his own black scark, hat, and foxhead medallion. Luca's circus is huge and has a lot of horses, a courtesy of Suroth for giving shelter to a SC animal trainer! Pips is in the Tarasin Palace stable but there isn't an easy way for Mat to get him. He thinks about Vanin stealing, but Mat can't ask Luca. Mat thinks about Rand and Perrin and there is a rush of colors in his head... now, my question is - is this part of t'averen or something else?? Mat sees Thom.. woo! THOM! and Beslan. Luca flirts with every woman he sees, and he's married now! Olver is there. Thom tells Mat that Luca will let them accompany him when he leaves but that won't be until spring. Mat, Thom, Olver, and Beslan head back to the Palace. Olver looks forward to his lesson with Riselle, the dice start tumbling!</p>

        <h2>Ch 16, An Unexpected Encounter, Wheel and Snake</h2>
        <p><strong>Mat.</strong> holy moly! Mordeth was a gholam?? Mat walks back to ED with Thom, Beslan, and Olver. Heads are outside the gates of those who've rebelled the SC. Inside, the streets are PACKED! The Return has started it seems. There is a rumor of a battle between the SC and Asha'man a week ago (so we are a bit.. back in time?). Mat goes towards the TP and recalls that Suroth is living there. Mat walks down an alley and the gholam from before attacks him. Mat uses his foxhead medallion to burn the gholam on the hands and face. Then a man shouts at the end of the alley and the gholam flees. Mat says he remembers seeing something like that in Shadar Logoth, which I think was Mordeth! This old man is Noal, the SC kicked him out of his room in The Golden Ducks. Mat offers him a room in the TP and they head that way.</p>

        <h2>Ch 17, Pink Ribbons, Dice</h2>
        <p><strong>Mat.</strong> I so wanted Tylin to say "the Daughter of Nine Moons"... ahh that'd been so good! Mat and Noal cross Mol Hara Square and Mat notes the statue of Qeen Nariene. They go into the TP, the now home of Suroth Saebelle Meldarath as well as Tylin. Thy talk to Surlivan Sarat a ED guard, and see numerous SC guards coming and going , as well as, several dozen damane being exercised by their sul'dam. Half are to be Windfinders. One is Teslyn! It has been a month and a half since the SC took ED. Mat takes Noal into his quaters, offers an out to his crew after telling them about the gholam. They refuse to leave. Mat goes to have a bath but runs into Juilin who also refuses to leave. Mat goes to Tylin's quaters and the dice crash to a stop because... Tylin is with Suroth, Selucia, Anath, and Tuon!! Mat knows Suroth, but no one else. Tuon is angry with Suroth because Mat is hurt - Suroth said the city was safe. Mat says he just fell, Tuon inspects Mat and she offers to buy him but Tylin says he's a free man. Tuon invites Tylin to look at maps as she is told she will be one of the Blood by Tuon. As Tylin leaves, Mat tells her about the ghola and a maid prepares Mat for pink ribbons.</p>

        <h2>Ch 18, An Offer, Seanchan</h2>
        <p><strong>Mat.</strong> I dislike chapters like this.. "this happened, then this happened, then THIS happened, and then THIS happened". Only things of note - the gholam killed someone, people think it was a wolf, more SC arrive everday and Ogier Gardeners too. Aludra is close to telling Mat her secret, they kiss now, Mat found a bellfounder Calwyn Sutoma. Suroth has commissioned thirteen of the largest bells ever created for a victory celebration. Lopin and Nerim are moving Mat's clothes and gold to The Wandering Woman. Tuon tries to buy Mat's ashandarei spear. Mat is going to leave ED.</p>

        <h2>Ch 19, Three Women, Tar Valon</h2>
        <p><strong>Mat.</strong> Hey, good chapter. I love Mat. He is such a good guy, even though he thinks he isn't. So is Setalle Anan, she is a great person.</p>

        <p>Mat is at the Wandering Woman, there is a man who is winning at cards (for some reason that was important). Marah Anan is snapping at Caira to take care of Air Captain Yulan, and then her brother Ross to help! Mat goes to the kitchen where Enid is there and she gives him breakfast. Setalle brings Joline in! Mat grabs Joline and covers her face as EGEANIN ENTERS, with someone who has an Illianer accent which has to be BAYLE DOMON right?? Wow, this is awesome. Egeanin is now Captain of the Green Lady Egeanin. Setalle says rooms are all booked - to people we've met Yulan and Furyk (TPOD!!). Setalle takes Joline to the cellar. Mat tells Joline that Teslyn was taken. Mat goes back to the TP and goes to Tylin's room, after seeing SF damane. Teslyn gave Mat the note because she wanted to frustrate Elaida's plans. Mat offers to help her escape too and she adds Edesina, and Guisin and Mylen but they're *too far gone to rescue*. Mat then runs into Tuon and he thinks she is beautiful, Mat wants Thom and Juilin to help him plan their escape!</p>

        <h2>Ch 20, Questions of Treason, A'dam</h2>
        <p><strong>Bethamin.</strong> This is awesome. </p>

        <p>Bethamin and Renna are inspecting the damane in the kennel in the TP. Renna used to be Suroth's best trainer, but now she is cowed. Bethamin threatens to report Renna to Essonde for laziness. Beth marks down a suggestion for Zushi, SF damane who cries constantly. Also a suggestion for Tessi(Teslyn) to have harsher training. Bethamin found Renna and Seta collared in Falme.. by Egwene, Nynaeve, and Elayne?? Beth left Falme and got captured by Egeanin. Beth is from the villiage of Abunai on the Sea of L'Heye. Beth is excited for Tuon to reveal herself as the Daughter of the Nine Moons. When she arrives at The Golden Swans of Heaven, the inkeeper Darnella Shoran tells her she doesn't like her guests having male visitors.. turns out he is in Beth's room and is a Seeker. He asks for brandy and Beth gives him some of Iona's (her roommate). He learned that Beth was asking after Egeanin. The Seekers tells her to renew her friendship with Egeanin and report to him. He explains the theory that Egeanin, Suroth, and Bayle Domon are in the league. They are responsible for Turak's death at Falme and are plotting something with the AS of this land. Beth has no choice but to agree to help the Seeker. Rand killed Turak..</p>

        <h2>Ch 21, A Matter of Property, Egeanin</h2>
        <p><strong>Egeanin.</strong> Egeanin and Bayle Domon are in their room at The Wandering Woman. I have a question: is Domon a darkfriend? Asking this because of the made a'dam that he and Egeanin gave to Suroth - of course they didn't throw these into the ocean. Since we know Suroth is a darkfriend. Egeanin.. isn't?? AHHH</p>

        <p>After they left Tanchico they sailed to Cantorin on the Seahawk where they were stopped by a Seanchan ship. Egeanin kept them from being sold by saying they had a gift for Suroth, the male a'dam. The Seekers seemed to already know about their ship and they had the male a'dam. Domon argued and was put up for sale - Egeanin bought him and made him so'jhin. Egeanin was promoted to the Blood and Captain of the Green. Domon wants to get married but she would have to free him first. A knock brings Bethamin, she tells Egeanin everything the Seeker asked. Egeanin orders her to visit every day, beth leaves. Egeanin orders Domon to leave but he refuses and Domon says he can find her a crew. Bayle recognized Mat in the kitchen and knows Thom was with him before. Egeanin remembers Thom and agrees to let Domon try to find them.. oh boy.</p>

        <h2>Ch 22, Out of Thin Air, Forsnaken</h2>
        <p><strong>Rand.</strong> now this.. this was awesome. Rand following Rochaid in Far Madding. AWESOME. Rand is in Far Madding there is a statue of Savion Amhara in the square, she points toward the Tea Gate. Raolin Darksbane was from Far Madding when it was called Aren Mador, Yurian Stonebow was from Far Madding when it was call Fel Moreina (false dragons). LTT tells Rand he was a fool to come to Far Madding. Ran can feel Min more strongly than the others - distance, right? Rand left clues for the Asha'man - Rand knows Torval, Dashiva, Gedwyn, and Kisman will come too. Rochaid has been here for two days. Rand follows Rochaid toward the Hall of the Counsels - Rand gets dizzy and sees a murky face, and stumbles into an Aielman. LTT whispers that Rand already destroyed them - "How many will we three kill before the end, I wonder". WHO IS THE OTHER?!~ Rand follows Rochaid into an alley, Rochaid was waiting and tried to attack Rand but Rand breaks his windpipe. Kisman is there and tries to attack, but Rand ducks and Kisman kill Rochaid. Guards come and Kisman runs. Rand runs the other way. Rand is sure the counsels will not harm the DR, but they have acepted Elaida's decree and would turn him over to the WT. oh boy.</p>

        <p><strong>Kisman.</strong> Good grief. IS TAIM DEMANDRED?! I don't think so.. only because of the phrasing of this pov. Kisman is furious with Rochaid - they were supposed to wait until everyone arrived, but they wanted the glory. The M'Hael ordered them to kill Rand in Caihrien and was furious when they failed and were found out. Taim made it clear Far Madding is their last chance. Dashiva vanished. Demandred later ordered them to kill Rand and not let Taim know about it. Then Moridin said to kill Rand and bring his possessions (the keys!). They are the only two Forsaken that Kisman has met, then Kisman feels a slash on his arm and his arm turns black but its too late... FAIN!?!</p>

        <p><strong>Rand.</strong> Rand can draw! That's cool lol. Rand returns to the inn - The Crown of Maredo, Lan, Min, Nynaeve, and Alivia are there. A SLIM INKEEPER.... DARKFRIEND! Rand is not sure about Alivia (she was damane and wants to kill sul'dam). Nynaeve wears her ki'sain and a bunch of jewelry and a ring on every finger... ANGREAL!!! Rand tells Lan what happened and they start packing. Alivia tells Rand he must let them help. Min still has her books and reads a lot. Min agrees they can help. Rand realizes he can draw good picures of the men, thanks to LTT!</p>

        <p><strong>Isam/Luc.</strong> Holy moly. What. Good gracious. Isam is in TAR in a badroom of an inn. He *steps into the real world and becomes Luc*. WHAT?! He recalls the assassinations of two AS in the Stone of Tear (TDR!! OH MY MY MY!) and the Gray Man in the White Tower (TSR! AHHHHH! THE CROSSBOW BOLT!!). He stabs the two figures in the bed with poisoned daggers and checks their identities. COULD LUC HAVE KILLED ADELEAS AND ISPAN?! OH WOW! Bald man and a gray woman. Luc returns to TAR where is "patron" is waiting. Luc can only tell that he is a man, he is disguised so that Luc cannot see his face or remember his voice. Luc thinks he must be one of the Chosen as few others know how to find him and none of those who are men can channel... what? Only the DO and the Chosen can command him. The man tells Luc to wait for further instructions before trying again, the man then Travels to a snowy forest glade. Luc is a bit disappointed, he really wanted to kill his nephew and the wench. So Rand and the wench (Nynaeve?). Luc becomes Isam again and goes hunting for wolves (SLAYER!!!!) Holy crap. What does that even mean?! Wow. </p>


        <h2>Ch 23, To Lose the Sun, Hand and Sword</h2>
        <p><strong>Shalon.</strong> I believe I've missed some things. I'm confused on Shalon's relatioship with Ailil. I skimmed a bit this chapter.. lol So, Cadsuane leads a party through a gateway in the SP to a clearing. Shalon isn't allowed to watch the weave. Shalon is with Harine and her swordmaster, Moad with 11 AS - Cadsuane, Alanna, Verin, Corele, Daigian, Kumira, Merise, Beldeine, Elza, Erian, Nesune, and Sarene. Their Warder as well, Ihvon, Tomas, Nethan, and Bassane. Eben, Damer, and Jahar are there too. Cadsuane rides up and tells them that they are in the Hills of Kintara near Far Madding. She assigns Sarene to instruct Harine. When they are a mile out of Far Madding, Sarene mentions that the men can no longer channel. She explains that there is a ter'angreal in the city. It blocks men from channeling at this distance. Women are blocked just outside the city. It is like being inside an Ogier stedding. As they approach the lake surrounding the city, Shalon feels herself cut off from the True Source. At the bridge, the guards take their names and wrap wire around all the men's swords so they cannot be drawn. The Warder object, but they are silenced at a sharp word from Merise. Shalon thinks they are like the guard dogs that the Amayar use. The party then rides through the Caemlyn Gate and enters the city. They pass through a square with a statue of Einion Avharin, an historic First Counsel. She points toward the Caemlyn Gate. They continue to ride into the city, but Shalon is still overwhelmed at the loss of the True Source. Neat!</p>

        <h2>Ch 24, Among the Counsels, Flame of TV</h2>
        <p><strong>Shalon.</strong> I tell you what, I am confused! Why is Verin going by Eadwina?? So, Cadsuane and crew enter the Hall of the Counsels in the central square of Far Madding. Aleis Barsalla is requested by Cadsuane. Verin and Kumira accompany her. Shalon notes that Jahar isn't with the other men now. Sarene explains that the First Counsel used to be advisor to the Queen of Maredo. Since Maredo fell apart, the First Counsels took over the whole job. I love learning history, wow! Cadsuane leads the crew to the central dome. Cadsuane was last in FM twenty years ago during the Aiel War. Kumira takes Shalon and Harine to see this thing in the center. It comprises three clouded crystal discs a span wide. Each disc has a clear crystal wedge that points to the center. The women of the Counsel arrive. Aleis welcomes harine and crew. Verin announces that a man just channeled and the wedges are now black and point roughly in the same direction - allowing someone to triangulate the position of the channeler. Kumira adds that the wedges would be red for a woman channeler.. that is so cool! The FC asks Verin's name and she is going by Eadwina. Verin brings up Guaire Amalasan's conquest of FM that took three weeks and then talks about the DR and the SC. Shalon and Harine are nice to each other.</p> 

        <h2>Ch 25, Bonds, Dragon</h2>
        <p><strong>Rand.</strong> Good chapter. Rand is in his room in The Counsel's Head that overlooks the Nethvin Market with Min. The Counsel's Head is better than The Crown of Maredo - he is playing Thom's flute. Min is there. Alanna has been in FM for a day. Min is upset with Alivia - Alivia is goin to help Rand die... interesting. LTT says death is a relief, Rand remembers "to live, you must die". Cadsuane and Alanna enter - Merise bonded Narishma, Corele bonded Damer, Daigian bonded Hopwil. Rand asks Alanna to release the bond, she refuses. Cadsuane tought Alanna how to Travel. The three Asha'man were afraid to go to the BT after the attack.  She tells him that Damer Healed Irgain, Ronaille and Sashalle. All of the Aes Sedai prisoners now have sworn fealty to Rand, but Cadsuane does not trust them. She would not let the five bring their Warder. Alanna begs Rand to let the Aes Sedai help him. She tells him that many do not like Dobraine in Cairhien and might support Toram Riatin if he reappears. Darlin is ruling in Tear, but the rebels in Haddon Mirk have not returned. Elayne may or may not support him in Andor. She reminds Rand that Rafela and Merana got everything he asked for in the treaty with Harine. Rand tells Alanna to go back to Cairhien and send Rafela, Merana, Bera and Faeldrin to Haddon Mirk to negotiate with the rebels there. Those were the four besides Alanna that Min said he could trust. Rand tells her she can come back to Far Madding after that. Alanna leaves and Rand decides that he must repair his relationship with Cadsuane.</p>

        <p><strong>Verin.</strong> Oh Verin, you sneaky sneaky!! Verin is awesome. Yes, now we know, Verin is using the name Eadwina because she was exiled from FM - thanks Joline. The women of Aleis' famliy have been involved with trade and politics since FM was called Fel Moreina. Verin finds Cadsuane and Elza yelling at Cadsuane. Cadsuane confides that she does not care what Rand does as long as he lives to reach Tarmon Gai'don and she can teach him to laugh and cry again. She learned that Min told him that he needs her, but she must still move carefully. Sure of Cadsuane at last, Verin slips the small vial back in her purse unopened... hmm.</p>

        <h2>Ch 26, Expectation, Wheel and Snake</h2>
        <p><strong>Elayne.</strong> Elayne is pregnant. OH! I have a prediction - my wife is pregnant too (not a prediction lol), I predict Elayne will have her baby before my wife does! She's do in October!</p>

        <p>Elayne and Eg are meeting in TAR in Emond's Field, its a thriving town. Eg will move her army to TV tomorrow (time stamp!). Eg says she doesn't want to heal the WT just so Rand can chain AS like damane. Avi is in bed with Elayne, people know Elayne is pregnant - people think Doilin Mellar (Daved Hanlon) is the father. Stuff and things are said. Elayne says she will go to meet with the Borderlands rulers with Merilille today.</p>

        <h2>Ch 27, To Surprise Kings and Queens, Lion</h2>
        <p><strong>Elayne.</strong> Yeah Elayne! Elayne is tired - Elayne, Merilille, Birgitte, and Aviendha go through a gateway provided by Reanne to the Shienaran camp. Lord Kayen Yokata of Fal Eisen, King Easar, Queen Ethenielle, King Paitar, and Queen Tenobia are there. They acknowledge they are looking for the DR. Tenobia demands Davram. Elayne says he is near Caemlyn. They all agree to peace - Elayne says Rand is near Murandy, Eg moved from Murandy to TV today. This move may force Arathelle, Luan and Pelivar to side with her. Strangely, the Borderlanders do not seem excited on learning where they can find Rand. Elayne, Birgitte, Aviendha and Merilille leave and ride until they are sure they have not been followed. Elayne then opens a gateway and they Travel back to a field south of Caemlyn that she knows well. By the time they make it back to the Royal Palace, Elayne is dozing. As Birgitte carries her into the palace, Halwin Norry insists that he has urgent news. There are four small armies, twenty or thirty thousand men, marching toward Caemlyn from the east. They will arrive within a week. Elayne heads to her apartments to begin planning the defense of Caemlyn. Woo!</p>

        <h2>Ch 28, News in a Cloth Sack, Harp</h2>
        <p><strong>Mat.</strong> I skimmed this chapter.. sorry lol. Tylin and Suroth leave for a tour of Altara, they'll be gone for a week - they will travel by to'raken. What I'd love is if they both died on this trip, that would make everything easier. Also, the trip was Tuon's idea. Also, I think Noal is Jain Farstrider.. I think. Julin brings Mat a cloth sack containing the sul'dam and damane dresses and the a'dam that Mat asked for. Also the gholam keeps killing.</p>

        <h2>Ch 29, Another Plan, A'dam</h2>
        <p><strong>Mat.</strong> Talk about a ta'veren pull! Mat taks the a'dam to The Wandering Woman, Joline doesn't was to try it, but Setalle insists. Setalle has already sole The Wandering Woman to Lydel Elonid. Jasfar Anan sailed for Illian three days ago with all their kin. Mat slips and meniots the second damane to be freed, then tells Joline that is Edesina Azzedin. Joline thinks that Setalle's voice is familiar... intrigue! Mat shows them how to open and close the a'dam, Setalle wears the bracelet and puts the collar on Joline. Joline then collapses in agony and quickly take off the a'dam, it is clear Setalle can't be a sul'dam. Bayle Domon takes Mat to Egeanin. She wants to hire Mat, Thom, and Juilin. Mat figures out that a Seeker is after Egeanin. Mat says he can get her away immediately if she can supply three sul'dam, she says she can. Mat then meets with Hom and Julin and they tell Mat about the male a'dam. Colors flash in Mat's head about Rand (i'm interested in this!). They agree Rand should know about the a'dam. They think it's still at the bottom of the sea.</p> 

        <h2>Ch 30, Cold, Fat Raindrops, Dice</h2>
        <p><strong>Mat.</strong> WOO! Mat gets his Ashandaeri, it's raining, Egeanin, Domon, Set, Renna, Setalle, Joline, Joline's Wards enter the Tarasin Palace.. it's about to be an escape!! WOO! also, I'm really excited about the next chapter title... "What the Alefinn Said"! WOO! </p>

        <h2>Ch 31, What the Aelfinn Said, Wheel and Snake</h2>
        <p><strong>Mat.</strong> Oh yes, "she is my wife". YES YES YES YES MAT YES MAT! Oh this is so awesome. And what a Robert Jordan Wheel of Time twist where literally everything that could go wrong, goes wrong because IT'S PART OF THE PATTERN. I LOVE THIS SO MUCH! </p>

        <p>Alright, Mat, Egeanin, Domon, Renna, and Seta go upstairs to the damane kennels. Mat goes to the nearest room to find a Windfinder, this is beautiful and amazing, Mat remembers taking passage on a SF ship from Allorallen to Barasha, he wakes her - it's Nestelle din Sakura South Star. He frees here and shows her how to work the a'dam and to wait three hours and freee the other Windfinders. When he comes out, Egeanin is talking to the der'sul'dam. Suroth gave her permission to use any damane she wants. Mat goes to Tylin's rooms to get his spear - Tylin is there early. Suroth returned early on hearing news that an army vanished from Murandy (EGWENE!!) and she goes to The Wandering Woman. Tylin kisses Mat and says she'll miss him, he ties her up. Tuon and Mat fight, Noal is there to help and Tuon is tied up. Julin arrives with Thera, Egeanin and Domon comes with Renna, Teslyn, Set, and Edesina. Egeanin says this is the DOT9M! Mat is stunned at the name and knows that "the Aelfinn told him the truth" and announces this is her wife, he says this three times.... oh was that imporant?? Selucia enters and says she will obey Mat as long as he doesn't harm her. Mat is taking everyone with him and Tuon smiles "as though she knows a secret". YES YES YES!</p>

        <h2>Ch 32, A Portion of Wisdom, Hand and Sword</h2>
        <p><strong>Rand.</strong> Rand agrees to have Cadsuane as his advisor. Nynaeve and Cadsuane will work out their differences, Nynaeve is excited. Rand goes back to The Counsel's Head. Lan comes in about the same time. Rand tells Lan that he has decided to leave and that he knows the girls are with Cadsuane. Lan tells him that they are trying to bring her closer to Rand. Nynaeve, Min and Alivia enter. Nynaeve still wears the bracelet and rings and the Jewelry Set. Rand tells them that he has asked Cadsuane to be his advisor and that he plans to leave tomorrow. Alivia thinks Cadsuane is remarkable, a strict teacher. Min thinks she is like a strict aunt. Nynaeve she and Cadsuane will work out their differences. Nynaeve is excited. Cadsuane showed her that the ring with green stone detects the use of saidar and saidin within three miles. The jeweled belt is a Well that can store saidar. She demonstrates its use, brushing Rand's face with Air. She thinks Cadsuane's hair ornaments might be similar ter'angreal. Mistress Keene comes up with a message for Rand and gives it to Min. Rand manages to get the note from Min before she can burn it. The note says that Kisman is dead. Torval and Gedwyn have taken rooms above the shop of Zeram the bootmaker on Blue Carp Street.... HMM! Let's kill em'! I'm guessing Fain wrote the letter.. that's my guess!</p>

        <h2>Ch 33, Blue Carp Steet, Dagger</h2>
        <p><strong>Min.</strong> Rand and Lan go to the Blue Carp Street to kill the Asha'man. Min and Alivia leave as well to find Cadsuane. </p>

        <p><strong>Rand.</strong> Rand scouts Zeram's house on Blue Carp Street while Lan and Nynaeve wait down the street. Rand buys a meat pie and asks the street vendor about Zeram. The vendor says Zeram's wife, Milsa rents out the top floor of their house. Lews Therin comments that he used to like meat pies. After a while, Rand sees Gedwyn and Torval enter. Lan and Nynaeve walk up. Nynaeve says the bracelet with red stones covers her with armor better than steel. They go back to the alley and Nynaeve uses the jeweled belt to lift Rand and Lan to the roof. They enter the attic via a trapdoor. They find another trapdoor and drop down into a storage room. They find Gedwyn and Torval dead, their bodies black and swollen. Rand realizes it was Fain and the wound in his side throbs. They open to door to the next room where Fain and Toram Riatin are waiting. Fain orders Toram Riatin to kill Lan, then focuses on Rand. Rand holds him off with his sword and Fain flees down the stairs. As Rand starts to follow, he sees a vision of Gedwyn and Torval climbing up. Gedwyn says they will not go near him until they know where the others are. "The M'Hael will kill us if...". Rand slashes through the visions and slashes the side of Fain's face. Fain shrieks and flees down the stairs. Lan comes over, having dispatched Toram Riatin, and tells Rand that guards are coming. They go back to the roof. Lan slips, Rand grabs his hand and they both fall to the alley below.</p>

        <p>And this is where Rand and Lan die, this is the last time we see Rand and Lan.. Dead from a ten foot drop.... lol jk. READING ON! </p>

        <h2>Ch 34, The Hummingbird's Secret, Flame of TV</h2>
        <p><strong>Nynaeve.</strong> Nyneave is dragged away, Cadsuane, Alivia, and Min are doing the draggin. Cadsuane says he will somehow help Rand and Lan. Cadsuane is angry that Nynave, the Counsels are in a panaic after detecting saidar being used within the city.</p>

        <P><strong>Rand.</strong> Oh no, Rand is in a box again. Rand is caged, Rand lists the women who died because of him. </P>

        <p><strong>Cadsuane.</strong> Hey, I don't think Cadsuane is a darkfriend anymore.. these people. Taim, now Cadsuane?! Everyone is switching in my mind. SO! This was awesome, Cadsuane, Min, Alivia, Nynaeve, the three good Asha'man (YAY!) help get Rand out of the cell because of Cadsuane's Well (golden hummingbird) in her hair. Also Cadsuane learned about enduring what must be endured in the Black Hill from a toothless wilder shortly before she was raised to the shawl. WOOOOO READING ON!</p>

        <h2>Ch 35, With the Choedan Kal, Aes Sedai</h2>
        <p><strong>Rand.</strong> I love this. Rand opens a gateway to SL, Rand and Nynaeve sit down, ready to begin. As Rand releases saidin he sees a vague image of a face that is almost recognizable. Taking the access keys, Nynave initiaes the link with Rand, then passes control back to him. Rand forms a conduit of saidar, then begins funneling saidin through it and into SL. WOW. WOW. WOW. </p>

        <p><strong>Elza.</strong> Cadsuane notes this will be felt in TV and all over the world. Links happen. Merise allows Elza to lead the circle. Jahar takes Callandor.</p>

        <p><strong>Barmellion.</strong> is on his way to the Nine Rings in in Trmonsien, love this. </p>

        <p><strong>Timna.</strong> In Tremalking, the giant statues glows like the sun and she is excited to see the fulfillment of prophecy and the end of Illusion. YES.</p>

        <p><strong>Cyndane.</strong> Gotta be Lanfear. She opens a gateway to the clearing.. she spins a web for death.</p>

        <p><strong>Cadsuane.</strong> Has a shrike angreal in her hair, the golden swallow in her hand points the direction of the sourfce of the attack. Jahar sends fountains of fire with Callandor. </p>

        <p><strong>Osan'gar.</strong> DASHIVA!!!!</p>

        <p><strong>Verin.</strong> A forsaken that verin tries to shield. the woman is too strong, she attacks verin kumira and shalon.</p>

        <p><strong>Hopwil.</strong> Aran'gar is here!!!</p>

        <p><strong>Cyndane.</strong> IS LANFEAR!!! Cyndane sees a woman standing in the woods. Cyndane prepares in case she is a wilder. As soon as the woman seizes saidar, Cyndane sends a ball of fire at her. When it reaches the woman, the web just comes apart. Cyndane thinks it must be some ter'angreal that she never heard of. Then the woman attacks. She is stronger that Cyndane was before the Aelfinn and Eelfinn held her. She must have an angreal,[13] too. Cyndane fights back, determined to see Lews Therin die.</p>

        <p><strong>Cadsuane.</strong> Goes to Heal Nynaeve because she is exahusted.</p>

        <p><strong>Osan'gar.</strong> Weaves balefire. </p>

        <p><strong>Elza.</strong> Darkfriend... she is linked and draws saidin from Callandor, she vaporizes the top fifty feel of the hill.... Osan'gar dead?? </p>

        <p><strong>Mogi.</strong> Moghedien feels no more channeling except for the access key. The battle must be over. The black dome is now two miles high. Suddenly the dome collapses in on itself and vanishes. The wind howls filling the void and lifting her into the air. She thinks that if she survives this she will never be afraid again. Whoa! </p>

        <p><strong>Cadsuane.</strong> The female access key is melted and broke. The male access key in in her saddlebags with Callandor. Where SL used to be there is now only a huge hole in the forest. Lan returns and goes to Nynave. Min to Rand. They're both unconscious and should recover on their own. Rand's wounds are unchanged. Damar Flinn Heals the wounded. Verin and Shalon pray over Kumira, Daigian weeps for Hopwil. Jahar and Damer say that saidin is clean... but Cadsuane wonders if the taint is completely gone... me too Cadsuane. Cadsuane intends to leave as soon as the other Warder return, now that she has Rand she doesn't intend to lose him. </p>
