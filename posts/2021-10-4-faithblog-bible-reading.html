            <h2 id="wtx">What to Expect?</h2>
            <p>I read the entirety of the bible in 2021. I wrote down my notes as I read.</p>
            
            <p>My first full read through of the Bible. Done in 239 days. List of numbers: 7.9 months, 239 days, 66 books, 1022 pages, February 8 to October 4. The NLT was an awesome read! Definitely made it easy to understand for me, being that I’ve been a believer for a while now. I’m excited to dive deeper with NASB and ESV study bibles. Not sure what I’m going to do next. Definitely swapping my NLT with my new NASB Bible in my backpack as an everyday carry! Woo! I did it!</p>
            
            <p>I also filmed a few videos of a <em>review of sorts</em> for my readings. I'll add those when we get to the different testaments.</p>
            
            <p>We'll start, with <strong>The Old Testament</strong>!</p>
            
            <h2>Genesis</h2>
            <p>February 8 - April 5</p>
            
            <p>Just finished and going through the notes and I see a note about Deuteronomy and I’m so excited to get to these laws. That probably won’t be for another few months as it seems.</p>
                
            <p>An excellent book. I am going to write down a more comprehensive dive into my findings in Genesis!</p>
            
            <h2>Exodus</h2>
            <p>April 5 - April 21</p>
            <p>Exodus 29. Exodus in general, wow. I am feeling so unworthy. I am unworthy of God. I am so small and unimportant. Wow, my God is so Great*.</p>
            
            <p>Wow.</p>
            
            
            <h2>Leviticus</h2>
            <p>April 21 - April 27</p>
            
            <p>Rules. Rules. Rules.</p>
            
            <p>Homosexuality.</p>
            
            <p>Or do you not know that the unrighteous will not inherit the kingdom of God? Do not be deceived: neither the sexually immoral, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor men who practice homosexuality, nor thieves, nor the greedy, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor swindlers will inherit the kingdom of God. And such were some of you. But you were washed, you were sanctified, you were justified in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and by the Spirit of our God.</p>
            
            
            <h2>Numbers</h2>
            <p>April 27 - May 25</p>
            
            <p>Wow. Numbers. Great stories. Rebellion against God, which killed A LOT of people. And Moses is soon to die. And I have a strange feeling about the selling of virgin girls.</p>
            
            
            <h2>Deuteronomy</h2>
            <p>May 25 - June 1</p>
            <p>Wow.</p>
            
            
            
            <h2>Joshua</h2>
            <p>June 1 - June 4</p>
            <p>Joshua was Moses’ successor for the Lord. He was good. Israel is in the Promised Land!</p>
            
            
            
            <h2>Judges</h2>
            <p>June 4 - June 9</p>
            <p>I was always under the impression that "Judges" was about laws and upholding laws, but in fact, Judges dealt with War and Battle! Yes, temporary leaders for war and conflict.</p>
            
            
            
            <h2>Ruth</h2>
            <p>June 9</p>
            <p>Okay, Ruth was a quick read! A beautiful story, and THATS WHERE DAVID CAME FROM! Wow!! Great stuff!</p>
            
            
            <h2>1 Samuel</h2>
            <p>June 8 - June 13</p>
            <p>1 Samuel is complete, and man, what a story. Samuel, dead. Saul, dead. David, alive for now! Everything is crazy, but again, another reminder that we need to keep our hearts turned to the Lord! We slip up and son constantly, but we have to keep God in our hearts. This is incredible, thank you all for sticking with my journey here and letting me bounce things off you all! It has been very helpful!</p>
            
            
            <h2>2 Samuel</h2>
            <p>June 13 - June 15</p>
            <p>2 Samuel is complete! Question, why or how did David sin by taking a census? God asked him to, but he asked him because he was angry with Israel. But I'm not sure why he was angry with Israel.</p>
            
            
            <h2>1 Kings</h2>
            <p>June 15 - June 18</p>
            <p>A smorgasbord of Kings of Israel and Judah that were either good or bad for Israel. I learned of Elijah and Elisha. Some prophets to really study.</p>
            
            
            <h2>2 Kings</h2>
            <p>June 18 - June 22</p>
            <p>Only a few good kings of the bunch. Josiah, and he was like no other. They just couldn't stay good. They had to do evil in the Lord's sight. And then Jerusalem destroyed too. Oh man. And then another exile. Oh man.</p>
            
            
            
            <h2>1 & 2 Chronicles</h2>
            <p>June 23</p>
            
            <p>Not to limit the Bible in its simple human terms, but people need to read this. This is incredible. It is so awesome to be a part of this history. Learning how our world was created, learning how our history was written, learning the stories of the origin of religion and our God. Wow. Some beautiful poetry and stories and awesome power!</p>
            
            
            
            <h2>Ezra</h2>
            <p>June 24</p>
            <p>I promise I’m not trying to speed through the Bible, but this is so much fun! Another book down! Ezra is complete and wow, the Temple is honestly so cool! I mean, of course now, the Temple is the church according to Corinthians. But, just another awesome book! Short too!</p>
            
            
            <h2>Nehemiah</h2>
            <p>June 25</p>
            <p>The book of Nehemiah is GREAT! I'm really enjoying my reading!!! Such a powerful story.</p>
            
            
            <h2>Esther</h2>
            <p>June 28</p>
            <p>Esther is complete! What a good book! I've heard a lot of about how awesome Esther was and it was nice to finally put some time into to read the book!</p>
            
            
            <h2>Job</h2>
            <p>June 29</p>
            <p>Job is complete! Okay what a delight to read! A real down to earth story about someone's life who really gets tested, but ends up better than before.</p>
            
            
            
            
            
            <h2>Psalms</h2>
            <p>June 29 - July 14</p>
            <p>And Psalm(s) is complete! How awesome is it that we get to “Praise him with a clash of cymbals; praise him with loud clanging cymbals.” <em>Psalms 150:5 NLT</em></p>
            
            <h2>Proverbs</h2>
            <p>July 14 - July 20</p>
            <p>I recorded a Bible reading from Psalm 86 on July 19. Could be the start of my faith ministry.</p>
            
            
            
            <p>Proverbs is complete! And wow! Such nice proverbs! Very tweetable! LOL also, having not read about the "Proverbs 31 Woman" it is so cool!</p>
            
            
            
            <h2>Ecclesiastes</h2>
            <p>July 20</p>
            
            <p>Well Ecclesiastes is complete. That was a quick read. Must be that wisdom literature that I've heard about. I understood pretty much everything, it was a bit depressing at times. But I'm sure that was the intent of Ecclesiastes. Really brings to light the "everything is meaningless". I also loved the teach of the young and the old! That'll preach!</p>
            
            
            
            <h2>Isaiah</h2>
            <p>July 22 - August 11</p>
            <p>Isaiah so far (up to 30) is superb! Jam packed with prophecy that WILL COME TRUE. Isaiah 7:14! Immanuel! Isaiah 25-26.</p>
            
            <p>“But those who die in the Lord will live; their bodies will rise again! Those who sleep in the earth will rise up and sing for joy! For your life-giving light will fall like dew on your people in the place of the dead!” <em>Isaiah 26:19 NLT</em></p>
            
            <p>So Isaiah 53 is most certainly about Jesus, right? The suffering servant who bore our sins, who was beaten so we could be whole, intercedes for the rebels?</p>
            
            <p>Isaiah is complete. Wow, the last 10 books blew my socks off!! Wow wow wow how awesome is our God!</p>
            
            
            <h2>Jeremiah</h2>
            <p>August 11 - August 20</p>
            <p>Jeremiah is complete, and I don’t have much to say other than this is definitely required reading for those wanting to get the whole story. I still can’t believe that we have this book that is God breathed, and we can read this anytime we want. To tell our history and God’s story, his people, and the triumph we are all looking forward to!</p>
            
            
            
            <h2>Lamentations</h2>
            <p>August 23</p>
            <p>A bit of a downer. But important. This is Jerusalem, being destroyed because of their sin and disobedience.</p>
            
            <p>“I will never forget this awful time, as I grieve over my loss. The faithful love of the Lord never ends! His mercies never cease. Great is his faithfulness; his mercies begin afresh each morning.” <em>Lamentations 3:20, 22-23 NLT</em></p>
            
            
            
            
            <h2>Ezekiel</h2>
            <p>August 23 - September 1</p>
            <p>Wow! The vision of the Temple! Ezekiel 37-49 is just incredible reading. So detailed. Ezekiel is a prophetic book that has superb biblical history. Wow! And the Levitical law brought back into play, yes!</p>
            
            
            
            
            <h2>Daniel</h2>
            <p>September 7</p>
            <p>What a book! Daniel is complete! Very very cool how the Prophets tie directly into Revelation. I'm basically reading all of revelation before actually reading revelation! So cool! Also, super crazy lol. An awesome book!</p>
            
            
            
            
            
            <h2>Hosea</h2>
            <p>September 8</p>
            <p>Short and sweet. Israel needs to come back to God.</p>
            
            <p>“But the people of Israel have bitterly provoked the Lord, so their Lord will now sentence them to death in payment for their sins.” <em>Hosea 12:14 NLT</em></p>
            
            
            
            
            <h2>Joel</h2>
            <p>September 8</p>
            <p>A hopeful book! Quick read.</p>
            
            <p>“Thousands upon thousands are waiting in the valley of decision. There the day of the Lord will soon arrive. The Lord’s voice will roar from Zion and thunder from Jerusalem, and the heavens and the earth will shake. But the Lord will be a refuge for his people, a strong fortress for the people of Israel.” <em>Joel 3:14, 16 NLT</em></p>
            
            
            
            <h2>Amos</h2>
            <p>September 8</p>
            <p>Hope for Restoration!</p>
            
            <p>“I hate all your show and pretense— the hypocrisy of your religious festivals and solemn assemblies. I will not accept your burnt offerings and grain offerings. I won’t even notice all your choice peace offerings. Away with your noisy hymns of praise! I will not listen to the music of your harps. Instead, I want to see a mighty flood of justice, an endless river of righteous living.” <em>Amos 5:21-24 NLT</em></p>
            
            
            
            
            <h2>Obadiah</h2>
            <p>September 8</p>
            <p>Who is Obadiah? Also, Israel is on the upswing!</p>
            
            <p>“Those who have been rescued will go up to Mount Zion in Jerusalem to rule over the mountains of Edom. And the Lord himself will be king!” <em>Obadiah 1:21 NLT</em></p>
            
            
            
            
            
            <h2>Jonah</h2>
            <p>September 8</p>
            <p>Jonah, classic! A BIG FISH NOT A WHALE. Also, very different from what I remembered. Jonah was upset with God. Jonah thought jumping into the sea would calm the storm, and it did. Also, “how can you sleep at a time like this?” Very similar to the Jesus sleeping story in the Gospels!</p>
            
            <p>“Then God said to Jonah, “Is it right for you to be angry because the plant died?” “Yes,” Jonah retorted, “even angry enough to die!” Then the Lord said, “You feel sorry about the plant, though you did nothing to put it there. It came quickly and died quickly. But Nineveh has more than 120,000 people living in spiritual darkness, not to mention all the animals. Shouldn’t I feel sorry for such a great city?” <em>Jonah 4:9-11 NLT</em></p>
            
            
            
            
            
            <h2>Micah</h2>
            <p>September 8</p>
            <p>Hope is COMING! I’m getting so excited reading these final books of the Old Testament. There is such a hope for Israel.</p>
            
            <p>“Once again you will have compassion on us. You will trample our sins under your feet and throw them into the depths of the ocean! You will show us your faithfulness and unfailing love as you promised to our ancestors Abraham and Jacob long ago.” <em>Micah 7:19-20 NLT</em></p>
            
            
            
            
            <h2>Nahum</h2>
            <p>September 8</p>
            <p>Not really sure where this book sits in time. Is it before Jonah, or after?</p>
            
            <p>“The Lord is good, a strong refuge when trouble comes. He is close to those who trust in him. But he will sweep away his enemies in an overwhelming flood. He will pursue his foes into the darkness of night.” <em>Nahum 1:7-8 NLT</em></p>
            
            
            
            
            
            <h2>Habakkuk</h2>
            <p>September 8</p>
            <p>A short book, where we get to see Habakkuk and God having an honest conversation. God knows what he wants.</p>
            
            <p>“Even though the fig trees have no blossoms, and there are no grapes on the vines; even though the olive crop fails, and the fields lie empty and barren; even though the flocks die in the fields, and the cattle barns are empty, yet I will rejoice in the Lord! I will be joyful in the God of my salvation! The Sovereign Lord is my strength! He makes me as surefooted as a deer, able to tread upon the heights. (For the choir director: This prayer is to be accompanied by stringed instruments.)” <em>Habakkuk 3:17-19 NLT</em></p>
            
            
            
            
            <h2>Zephaniah</h2>
            <p>September 8</p>
            <p>A call for destruction on all sinners.</p>
            
            
            
            
            <h2>Haggai</h2>
            <p>September 8</p>
            <p>Haggai is AWESOME! So cool to see God’s people turning it around!</p>
            
            <p>Well time just flew by, I just devoured Hosea, Joel, Amos, Obadiah, Jonah, Micah, Nahum, and Habakkuk! Wow! These books are incredible! Habakkuk especially! Some awesome awesome stuff! Obviously terrible for us here on earth in our ever deserving demise, but just the hope for a Savior! Whoa! Powerful! Also, Jonah is so much more than what I've always been told.</p>
            
            
            <h2>Zechariah</h2>
            <p>September 8</p>
            <p>Jesus’ prophecy basically revealed. All that is written will come true. Such a great book! One more book to go and I finish the Old Testament!</p>
            
            
            
            
            <h2>Malachi</h2>
            <p>September 8</p>
            <p>I did it! Old Testament complete! Malachi is jam packed with prophecy and Jesus’ background! Also, “sending Elijah”?</p>

                <blockquote>Here is my video on the Old Testament Reading</blockquote>
            
            <h2>Old Testament = Complete</h2>
            <p>Wow, February 8 - September 8, the Old Testament is complete. 775 pages, 36 books. 4 highlighters. So much history and prophecy and information. I’m so amazed and happy and joyful and excited to continue on this journey!</p>
            
            <p>Oh my goodness, I just used the NASB study Bible you gave me and WOWOWOWOWOWOW! This thing is awesome!! A little much to carry around, so I’m going to get a thin line with reference NASB. But I’m going to finish with NLT and then do a full reread with NASB!! I’m ecstatic!</p>
            
            
            <h2>Matthew</h2>
            <p>September 9 - September 10</p>
            <p>Matthew is complete, and I'm so excited to preach! This book was too short, it almost felt like a highlight reel. I look forward to reading the rest of the gospels to get the different perspectives! Also, the Trinity is everywhere! I came in with silly presuppositions from listening to bible debates about modalism and Unitarianism and such. But man oh man is the Trinity everywhere!</p>
            
            <p>As an example: “Therefore, go and make disciples of all the nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit.” <em>Matthew 28:19 NLT</em></p>
            
            <p>In the "name" not names. They are ONE!</p>
            
            
            <h2>Mark</h2>
            <p>September 10 - September 12</p>
            <p>Mark is complete, and I love Mark’s gospel! Another jam packed story of Jesus’ life, death, a little bit of resurrection. Interesting about the shorter vs longer endings. I appreciate that in my Bible it has both.</p>
            
            <p>Jesus has assessed to the right hand of God as the Risen King!</p>
            
            
            
            
            <h2>Luke</h2>
            <p>September 12 - September 13</p>
            <p>The Parable of the Rich Man and Lazarus…. Wow! So much about heaven and hell! Luke 16:19-31 Luke 24! Incredible! Jesus appearing as his resurrected self, talking about what’s to come! Chills! Luke is complete and I have to start John tonight!</p>
            
            
            
            
            <h2>John</h2>
            <p>September 13 - September 15</p>
            <p>The Gospel According to John is BRINGING THE HEAT! BOOM! WOW! Truly, I just finished Jesus' prayer, so I'm not done yet. But really 13-17 so far have the cake. So much theology and truth and faith. I'm jealous of anyone whose read this before me. I wish I'd read this all sooner.</p>
            
            <p>Haha, the gospel according to John is complete! I love how John talks about this account being true because he said it.</p>
            
            
            
            <h2>Acts of the Apostles</h2>
            <p>September 16 - September 18</p>
            <p>I appreciate the NLT in Acts 2:4</p>
            
            <p>“And everyone present was filled with the Holy Spirit and began speaking in other languages, as the Holy Spirit gave them this ability.” <em>Acts 2:4</em></p>
            
            <p>Footnotes does say, in other tongues. Fascinating that Speaking in Tongues has been perverted. Now, I could be totally wrong, I haven't read all of Acts or the rest of the New Testament. But my backhand knowledge is that Speaking in Tongues is not what it was then.</p>
            
            <p>It is terrible that Satan has a hold on this world. If people would just read the Word, the world would be saved. The Bible is incredible. Our God is incredible. Why don't people believe?</p>
            
            <p>Not to join the Bible with anything like Star Wars, but it's almost like: Knowing of Paul and his conversion, and seeing "there was a young man named Saul", is like watching Episodes 4-6 THEN 1-3....</p>
            
            <p>Specifically, “and dragged him out of the city and began to stone him. His accusers took off their coats and laid them at the feet of a young man named Saul.” <em>Acts 7:58 NLT</em></p>
            
            
            
            
            <h2>Romans</h2>
            <p>September 20</p>
            <p>Just a smorgasbord of theology! Resurrection! Faith based salvation! Adam and Christ! Life in Jesus!</p>
            
            
            
            
            
            <h2>1 Corinthians</h2>
            <p>September 20 - September 22</p>
            <p>Whoa. Very heavy stuff in Chapter 11-16. Resurrection of Christ, Resurrection of US! Rules for worship, women not to speak…spicy, love love love! Incredible stuff.</p>
            
            <p>I think before reading the Bible I didn’t know:</p>
            
            <ol>
                <li>that we were going to resurrect, truly all(good and bad people, or faithful and not faithful) would resurrect</li>
                <li>that hell was actually an “intermediary state”, Greek Hades. Luke 16, Rich man and Lazarus, the rich man is in eternal torment in hades and Lazarus is in Abraham’s bosom in hades. Or heaven. I’m not really fully understanding this part yet.</li>
                <li>I am a Calvinist. I believe in the 5 points of Calvinism. Election was my biggest “hurdle”, and after reading the many verses about the elect or God’s chosen, I realized that’s it. Also, predestination, all five points.</li>
                <li>the Old Testament really points directly to Jesus.</li>
            </ol>
            
            
            
            <h2>2 Corinthians</h2>
            <p>September 22 - September 23</p>
            <p>2 Corinthians complete, and THIRD HEAVEN! In my research: <a href=https://www.gotquestions.org/Paul-third-heaven.html target="_blank">here</a>, refers to being with God in heaven. Heaven(s) one and two refer to sky and space, or so my research says. And wow! What a book!</p>
            
            
            
            <h2>Galatians</h2>
            <p>September 23</p>
            <p>Paul’s Epistle to the Galatians, wow! I keep saying wow because this word is literally life changing. Galatians 3 is yet another example of how we are saved by Faith alone. There are examples of how Abraham was saved by faith, before the law, and how people were saved after the law wasn’t needed anymore - when Christ came! Wow.</p>
            
            
            
            
            
            <h2>Ephesians</h2>
            <p>September 24</p>
            <p>Whoa. Paul bringing the heat of God’s elect, of faith alone salvation, and unity, and being children of the Light! As well, singing praises and being submissive to our relationships.</p>
            
            
            
            
            
            <h2>Phillippians</h2>
            <p>September 24</p>
            <p>A short book, a good book! Living as citizens of Heaven!</p>
            
            
            
            <h2>Colossians</h2>
            <p>September 29</p>
            <p>A fitting book about NEW LIFE POST BAPTISM! Something to read for baptisms. As well, instructions for Christian households.</p>
            
            
            <h2>1 Thessalonians</h2>
            <p>September 29</p>
            <p>The HOPE FOR RESURRECTION, yes! More and more of this please!</p>
            
            <p>“And now, dear brothers and sisters, we want you to know what will happen to the believers who have died so you will not grieve like people who have no hope. For since we believe that Jesus died and was raised to life again, we also believe that when Jesus returns, God will bring back with him the believers who have died. We tell you this directly from the Lord: We who are still living when the Lord returns will not meet him ahead of those who have died. For the Lord himself will come down from heaven with a commanding shout, with the voice of the archangel, and with the trumpet call of God. First, the believers who have died will rise from their graves. Then, together with them, we who are still alive and remain on the earth will be caught up in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air. Then we will be with the Lord forever. So encourage each other with these words.” <em>1 Thessalonians 4:13-18 NLT</em></p>
            
            
            
            <h2>2 Thessalonians</h2>
            <p>September 29</p>
            <p>Man of Lawlessness! Oh no, satan or the “antichrist”, this must be where people get the “Anti Christ”.</p>
            
            
            
            <h2>1 Timothy</h2>
            <p>September 29</p>
            <p>Wow! An excellent example and “the example” of how a church should be. Elders and Deacons, teachers. How to live Godly.</p>
            
            
            
            
            
            <h2>2 Timothy</h2>
            <p>September 29</p>
            <p>A good book for good teaching! Too short.</p>
            
            
            
            
            
            <h2>Philemon</h2>
            <p>September 29</p>
            <p>Not much to say on this, just a very short 25 verses about Onesimus, a Brother in the Lord!</p>
            
            
            
            
            
            <h2>Hebrews</h2>
            <p>October 1</p>
            <p>My first thoughts… incredible! Seems like this is written directly to EARLY Christians and new believers. And I love that. This is an incredible highlight reel of the Old and New Testament for new believers. Amazing what this one book has to say about faith and Christ!</p>
            
            
            
            
            
            <h2>James</h2>
            <p>October 1</p>
            <p>What’s James got with Works? “So you see, faith by itself isn’t enough. Unless it produces good deeds, it is dead and useless.” <em>James 2:17 NLT</em></p>
            
            
            
            <h2>1 Peter</h2>
            <p>October 4</p>
            <p>A letter to those NEW BELIEVERS! This gets me so excited, reading this!</p>
            
            
            
            <h2>2 Peter</h2>
            <p>October 4</p>
            <p>One day is a thousand years to God.</p>
            
            
            
            
            <h2>1 John</h2>
            <p>October 4</p>
            <p>Three witnesses! Also, “And we know that the Son of God has come, and he has given us understanding so that we can know the true God. And now we live in fellowship with the true God because we live in fellowship with his Son, Jesus Christ. He is the only true God, and he is eternal life.” <em>1 John 5:20 NLT</em></p>
            
            
            
            
            <h2>2 John</h2>
            <p>October 4</p>
            <p>Make sure to remember Jesus came into this world in a <strong>real body</strong>!</p>
            
            
            
            
            <h2>3 John</h2>
            <p>October 4</p>
            <p>A very short letter, with Gaius! As well, Diotephes, who doesn’t like the apostles.</p>
            
            
            
            <h2>Jude</h2>
            <p>October 4</p>
            <p>A short, seemingly “controversial” book. With Jesus in place of The Lord in V. 5: “So I want to remind you, though you already know these things, that Jesus first rescued the nation of Israel from Egypt, but later he destroyed those who did not remain faithful.” <em>Jude 1:5 NLT</em></p>
            
            
            <p>As well, Jude uses Enoch 1:9, a book specifically during the intertestamental period: (Enoch, who lived in the seventh generation after Adam, prophesied about these people. He said, "Listen! The Lord is coming with countless thousands of his holy ones 15 to execute judgment on the people of the world. He will convict every person of all the ungodly things they have done and for all the insults that ungodly sinners have spoken against him. 14-15 The quotation comes from intertestamental literature: Enoch 1:9.)</p>
            
            
            
            
            <h2>Revelation</h2>
            <p>October 4</p>
            <p>Definitely going to need to sleep on this thought process of Revelation. But wow oh wow. Satan defeated, with death! Jesus is victorious! White robes, angels, elders, thrones, harps, streets of gold, resurrection (first and second), a thousand years, alpha and omega. Wow.</p>
            
            <p>A fitting end to an incredible book! The Bible! </p>
            
            
            
                <h2 id="new">The New Testament</h2>
