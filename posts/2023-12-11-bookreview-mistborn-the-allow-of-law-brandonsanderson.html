<h2>Written Review</h2>
<p>Well this was just plain FUN! Come on now, Mistborn with GUNS?! I was blown away by this book. This was such a neat story in the mistborn world with... so few mistborns! Wow, that is something I'll talk about in the spoiler section but - this was a great book! </p>

<p>Set some 300+ years in the future from the ending of the first Mistborn trilogy, we are in a world with a history of that original trilogy.. and it is GREAT! This is such a fun take on the mistborn magic system and now we have seen the advancement in science and technology to ELECTRICITY and RAILROADS! A lot of fun to read, really well written and described. I'm so happy to read the tidbits that talk about the history of the world before then and wow, this is so much fun!</p>

<p>I am constantly impressed with Brandon Sanderson's storytelling and this was just another incredible story here. A gunslinger story about a crew stopping a robbing crew with a Brandon Sanderson magic sytem?! WOO! And woo, the dialogue here is incredible. Wax and Wayne, our lead characters are something special. This book is humorous and I truly laughed out loud and I even had to tell my wife and she laughed too! Wayne is a hilarious character and plays very well against every character on the page. </p>

<p>Brandon Sanderson is able to write every story he writes with such a great think-piece. There are characters that have great motivations and feel real, and this is just so good. You understand every side to every question. </p>

<p>The magic system has matured here and it is exciting! Things are still hidden to us, the readers, and the impact on the magic system on the world is still there from Era 1. Ah, this is just such a good book. </p>

<p>Mistborn has always been a smaller story compared to The Stormlight Archive and this is no exception, but we have such a history behind this book to hold it up. Great stuff here. Also, not much polotics here... love that. </p>

<p>The plot is quick and exciting. The world-building is great. I am a huge fan, for some reason, of Book Ones and The Allow of Law is no exception! I look so forward to reading the next book, Shadows of Self. </p>
