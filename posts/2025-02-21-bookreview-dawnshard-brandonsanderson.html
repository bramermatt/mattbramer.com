        <p>What an incredible novella from Brandon Sanderson's Stormlight Archive. Dawnshard is a story that takes Rysn and Lopen on a trip to help save Chiri-Chiri! This is, I'll say it, an excellent look at a fantasy world from the perspective of a paraplegic--to my understanding.</p>

        <p>Brandon Sanderson is writing, what I can only assume is called a modern fantasy. It's a world that has magic, but it also has science. It's super cool to read about, and really makes me think about the world in a totally different light. Both the fantasy world of Roshar, and my world. </p>
            
        <p>The magic system here is very well developed, of course, because there has already been some 1.3 million words in this world so far. That doesn't include the rest of the books in the connected universe that is the Cosmere. I love this magic system, it is intriguing and exciting. </p>
            
        <p>Rysn and Lopen are an interesting pair to put together, they both have physical disabilities. Lopen had one arm, prior to his swearing the Windrunner Ideals. Rysn, as mentioned before, is a paraplegic. They have great chemistry, and it's quite wholesome to read their dialog. It is also hard to read the perspective of a paraplegic, Rsyn--not Brandon Sanderson. Brandon used some incredible coaches that helped him learn what it is like, and it seems to be written very accurately. Brandon also puts into the story that there are multiple people experiencing that particular situation. They have an interconnected network and can communicate through spanreeds, it's wonderful!</p>
            
        <p>One of the most compelling aspects of Dawnshard is how it expands the lore of the Cosmere. While it's a short book compared to the main Stormlight Archive novels, it introduces major revelations about the ancient and powerful Dawnshards—one of the fundamental mysteries of this universe. The way Sanderson subtly weaves these deeper elements into what initially seems like a straightforward adventure is brilliant.</p>
            
        <p>Additionally, Dawnshard highlights Sanderson's signature worldbuilding. The setting of Aimia, with its bizarre ecology and hidden history, adds a layer of intrigue that have a deep lore. The way the characters interact with their environment—especially Rysn’s growing understanding of her unique role—feels real, that's what I can say about all of Sanderson's worlds and characters: they feel real.</p>
            
        <p>And let’s not forget Chiri-Chiri! This little larkin is more than just a pet—she plays a significant role in the story, and her relationship with Rysn is heartwarming. Seeing her grow and change alongside Rysn is such a satisfying element of the novella.</p>
            
        <p>The book isn’t just about magic or grand revelations—it’s also about resilience, adaptation, and the strength found in community. Sanderson writes humor, action, and adds emotional depth, making Dawnshard an unforgettable read, whether it’s your first time or a re-read!
