            <h2>Written Review</h2>
            <p>My, oh, my! What an outstanding novel by Dr. Philip Chase! Are YOU in the mood for a classic fantasy with the pacing of a modern fantasy story?! Are YOU interested in a self-published author? Are you interested in sorcerery / wizardry / medieval battle / gore / monsters?! </p>
            
            <h2>The Way of Edan</h2>
            <p>THE WAY OF EDAN IS IT FOR YOU! Oh my gosh, this book was absolutely electrifying. My goodness this story hooked me from the first page and didn't let go the entire time. </p>
            
            <h2>Classic Fantasy</h2>
            <p>I said "classic fantasy" and it is there, but this is a fresh take on a "chosen one" type fantasy story. And I was taken by the prose and world-building by this story; and this is book one in a trilogy. There is so much in this world that are beautiful and exciting and deep and I can't wait to read more. </p>
            
            <h2>World Building</h2>
            <p>This world is breathtaking and diverse and exciting. There is so much lore to this story and to this world, goodness I could gush on and on about this. You will not be disappointed reading this, and you will be helping out a self-published author and that's super cool.</p>
            
            <h2>Prose</h2>
            <p>I mentioned the prose, here is an example at which I fell in love the story: "Sequara's eyes widened a fraction as she released herself into the realm of origins... leaving behind her body, she joined her surroundings, aware of every emotion yet detached from all like an ethereal observer. She heard her voice chant the song of origin, "Druanil vardunay nanduinae...". This is what I want out of a fantasy story. I love the stories that have a slice of a world that is extra / multiple realm-type worlds. </p>
            
            <h2>Chosen One</h2>
            <p>This story is a chosen one story, that is familiar, but this is different. You might feel "ah this is just another chosen one story", but this is fresh. You'll see as you read. </p>
            
            <h2>Races</h2>
            <p>There are so much more than just humans here. There are humans, then DWARVES or Dweorgs, then Vikings or Thojns, DRAGONS, TROLLS, ELVES, these things called pucas that I find "golum" would be the best description. Absolutely incredible. These are all different type of races and peoples. </p>
            
            <h2>Violent</h2>
            <p>This is brutal and visceral. I'll just say that. </p>
            
            <h2>The Magic System</h2>
            <p>This is a super interesting "soft" magic system. This was very interconnected with the world and it's history and it's use. Sorcerers and Sorceresses, "songs" of origins, realm of the origins, realm of the forms. There is a sorceress who shoots fire from her fingertips. This is known as an empathic magic system, where people touch and reach toward minds and gain access to emotions. Emotions of everything: animals, beasts, humans, all. </p>

            <blockquote>
            Prologue
        Well goodNESS! That was crazy, so many names and things and people just introduced and the priests following the Way of Edan dumped poop and pee on their house of worship - then they were promptly murdered! 
        
        What an electrifying start!
        
        Ch 1: Troubles from Outside
        Good gracious this is brutal. Oswy dead, his son never to hold his staff, having never been born. This story is already incredible and impecable. The prose is beautiful, and sweet, and smooth. There is so much history to these words. I love this story so far. 
        
        Something is wrong in Kinsford. Also, this is a story with an incredible backstory it seems. We are getting so much so quickly, it is a tad overwhelming but I look forward to reading on and seeing what is going on in this world. 
        
        Ch 2: Where Memories Dwell
        HECK. My goodness, I am hooked into this story! This is impressive and exciting and wonderful! LET'S GO! 
        
        "Sequara's eyes widened a fration as she released herself into the realm of origins... leaving behind her body, she joined her surroundings, aware of every emotion yet detached from all like an ethereal observer. She heard her voice chant the song of origin, "Druanil vardunay nanduinae..." AHHH I LOVE IT!
        
        Ch 3: The Hunt
        My goodness, I keep saying that, but this might be my favorite book of the year. Line after line has me flabergasted by the prose and the worldbuilding of this. HOLY CRAP. AHHHH. Dayraven is being taken in by an elf - not a kind elf. Dayraven a gift with animals. AHHH I LOVE THIS SO MUCH.
        
        Ch 4: The Awakening
        My goodness. What a wild ride that chapter. Dayraven was under the elf-sleep. Then Bagsac (what a name) a priest following the Way of Edan came in a declared him to be without soul and to be killed. Then Urd came in a "awoke" him. Then they went to the Doomring and was declared to be Exiled from The Mark. Imharr was released from his bond to Edgil (Dayraven's father, thegn of Earl Stigand of Kinsford). Wow. WHAT A CHAPTER!
        
        Ch 5: Under the Stars
        Whoa, DAYRAVEN IS THE PROPHET OF EDAN?! The rebirth of the first Prophet of Edan? Making Dayraven a WIZARD? He has a gift?! I'M SO IN! Imharr will accompany Dayraven to find Galdor and help train Dayraven in his power. LOVE IT! 
        
        Ch 6: The Power in Torrhelm
        Well, whoa. That was intense. Supreme Priest Bledla is CRAZY AND TORTUROUS. So, these "rival" priests, I'll call them, were sent by Galdor to someone in Torrhelm, but they won't tell Bledla. In a cell, the King met with the priests and Bledla had one rival priest killed by a Gruddug, a horrible beast that eats it's victums - it has no teeth is yellow and disgusting. Eyeless and lives under the earth. Bledla then "delves" I'll call it, a preist and ends up bursting his entire head open from the power Bledla was willing into him. Another priest offered words of love that this rival priest might "merge wills" and take over Bledla; he didn't. He ended up being pushed into the hole after his head burst. WOW. BRUTAL.
        
        Ch 7: A Dawn Attack
        Alright, I'm seeing a little more of the story now. Dayraven and Imharr are off. Bagsac and some priests came to kill Urd and Dayraven. But Dayraven and Imharr were already off. Urd had set several curses upon her circle of oaks and she was able to interact with the priests coming at her. With birds and elk, she was able to steal a horse and escape after Bagsac was hurt.
        
        A lot of what happened in this chapter was shouting curses - the language was not english and I didn't know what was going to happen until it was explained to me. There was also some singing, at least one song. Now, the song had some relevance to the story and then the song was explained as well. 
        
        I'm a little worried, since this story had such an electrifying start and now things are showing that I'm not too excited about. This is a Chosen One story, of course. I haven't read much of wizardry, other than Harry Potter (only three books in so far), but that is a world full of wizardry. This seems to have more than just wizardry, this has swords and battles and creatures and more. I am very interested in this world and this story. 
        
        I'm excited to see what happens next, I hope I still feel the same electricity throughout the story! 127 pages in. 
        
        Ch 8: Secret Knowledge
        Okay, I'm liking this. Let's do this!
        
        Plot A: Dayraven and Imharr going to Galdon to learn and train Dayraven as the Prophet of Edan and a wizard. Plot B: This war put on by Sequara and the Way of Edan's priests Bledla against EVERYONE who doesn't follow Edan. Plot C: Joruman trying to overthrow all the Way of Edan stands for as false. 
        
        Ch 9: The Way Back
        Ahhhh, GIVE ME MORE OF THIS! Love this. Dayraven taking on the priest while using the realm of the origins and the forms with the energy. AHHH! I LOVE IT! 
        
        Ch 10: Woven of Words
        YEP. Yep, I love this story. I love this magic. Please more, please more! We're following Sequara again, and apparently there is a mole in the priestdom of the Way of Edan. And there are thoughts that Bledla might not be the Second Prohpet... uh oh! I think we are all aware Dayraven is the Second Prophet. The Song of the Origin was given to Sequara and now she needs to give it to Queen Fladira who then gives it to Galdor who then gives it to Dayraven! I LOVE THIS! We also got some of the wizard's fire - lightning coming from willed energy from the song of origin sang from Sequara. WOW. 
        
        Ch 11: At the Crossroads
        Hey hey, Dayraven and Imharr are now a part of a band of Mercenaries. They're trying to escape, because there is a sort of big deal happening with Dayraven. Let's see how long it takes them to escape! 
        
        Ch 12: The Call to War
        Welp, King of Eormonlond Earconwald is not a good man. Beats his wife, is lying to his people - he just wants all the power for himself. There was an assassin in his midst - nearly got him! They are planning their assault on Caergilion soon. It seems like Dayraven and Imharr will end up in this army.. just seems that way since the Captain of the Etinstone army was head of the mercinaries. That's it! That's where Dayraven and crew are going!
        
        Ch 13: The Old Work of Giants
        DRAGONS! Amlar Mountains - trolls and dragons remain in greatest numbers... eastern end lies Slith, greatest of fens, wherein dwell foul aglaks. YES! Also lore dumps, this world is huge. Imharr gets a sword... Dweorg make - names it Wreaker! But, he and Dayraven had to give up their horses. Also Dayraven and Imharr sign up for the Mercenary group, ready to muster for WAR! Dayraven beats Wigstan in a fight. 
        
        Ch 14: The Eternal Worship
        My goodness that was a spectacular chapter. My goodness. 
        
        Ch 15: In the Company of Mercenaries
        Gnorn, Hlokk, Dayraven, and Imharr. Captain Orvandil.. Thjoth of Grimrik - one of those who took the Fyrnhowes over our people's slain bodies. AWESOME, Dayraven is learning to control the "gift". How do Captain Orvandil and Dayraven know each other?!
        
        Ch 16: Past, Present, and Future
        DAYRAVEN IS THE KEY TO THE FUTURE OF ALL HUMANITY. I love it, I love it so much. LET'S GO! Urd met with Sequana and Faldira, Past Present Future. Love it. Sequana will go get Dayraven and Imharr away from the war. Also, Urd saw Dayraven and Imharr killed in a vision - not sure if that's real or not. 
        
        Ch 17: In The Monster's Clutches
        AHHH THAT WAS TENSE. Dayraven and crew fought an Aglak and Dayraven used his gift to control the aglak to save Captain Orv - then Joruman saved them. Then Dayraven and Orv met Bledla (tense!). Joruman plots to kill Dayraven. Bledla is having doubts that he is not the second prohpet - he believes Dayraven might. He will pray for a sign. TENSE!
        
        Ch 18: Chasing the Impossible page 342 (106 pages to go)
        Ah, Sequana has gotten some assistance for the war. And Duke Anarad is IMHARR'S UNCLE! Wow, love that. 
        
        Ch 19: Stalking The Enemy
        Abor - friend of Galdor, glad he has an eye on Dayraven (why would Imharr know about that?). This Brond, definitely the one to try to kill Dayraven. Also, this description of marching and war... perfection. 
        
        Ch 20: At Bay in Caergilin
        It IS HAPPENEING! THE WAR IS HERE! Sequana is a master. AH I LOVE THIS STORY. 
        
        Ch 21: The War of the Way
        I AM PUMPED FOR THIS BATTLE! LET'S GO! That was incredible. 14 feet-tall trolls?! I LOVED THAT SO MUCH. That was incredible. I'm so glad we got this war in THIS BOOK. Such incredible writing. Hlokk... rip. Also, almost Dayraven AGAIN, my goodness - can we get some more people guarding Dayraven please?! Luckily Sequana was there to help him. Literally willed his energy to come back. HOLY SMOKES. EPIC.
        
        Also, doesn't look like the last time Dayraven will be dealing with Bledla.. ;)
        
        Ch 22: The Choice
        "Often fate favors those who meet it with courage", what a line. Ah, sad. Imharr is going to fight with his uncle and everyone else: Gnorn, Orv, Sequara, Abon, and a few more are going to take Dayraven to Andanon's coast and to Urd. AHHH!
        
        Epilogue
        THEY ARE GOING TO USE DRAGONS AGAINST THE ADANESE?! OH MY GOSH!! THAT IS INCREDIBLE!
