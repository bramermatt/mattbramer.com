                <h2>Intro</h2>
                <p>This is a solid biography—well-researched, well-written, and surprisingly readable for covering such a dense and important life. <a href="https://www.harpercollins.com/products/john-quincy-adams-harlow-giles-unger" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Harlow Giles Unger</a> doesn't just tell the story of a former president—he revives a figure who’s often brushed over in American history books but was, in truth, one of the most brilliant and service-minded leaders this country has ever had. Truth be told, I often skip over <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Quincy_Adams" target="_blank" rel="noopener">John Quincy Adams</a> as I recount the US Presidents. After reading this, I will not forget JQA!</p>

                <h2>Prose</h2>
                <p>Unger’s writing is clean and confident. He brings energy to Adams’s life without over-dramatizing (which can certainly happen elsewhere). The narrative is chronological, accessible, and always moving forward—you never feel bogged down in academic details. Good stuff!</p>

                <h2>Early Life</h2>
                <p>As a boy, John Quincy Adams (JQA) witnessed the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Revolution" target="_blank" rel="noopener">American Revolution</a> firsthand and even traveled with his father on diplomatic missions. He kept journals from age 12 and studied at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvard_University" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Harvard</a>, where he developed the fierce intellect and moral clarity that would define him. This is one of the fullest eye-witness accounts we have of the Revolution, I may read his diary as it's out there for reading!</p>

                <h2>Career</h2>
                <p>JQA is, without a doubt, an underappreciated president. That becomes clear very quickly as you walk through his life. He was the son of a president—<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Adams" target="_blank" rel="noopener">John Adams</a>—and carried the weight of that legacy with grace and integrity. But JQA didn’t coast on his father’s name. He built his own legacy, through intellect, moral conviction, and service.</p>

                <p>He was already a diplomat by his teens, serving in foreign posts and even acting as secretary to the U.S. minister in Russia. He mastered multiple languages, including Latin, Greek, French, German, and Dutch. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Washington" target="_blank" rel="noopener">George Washington</a> himself called him the most valuable public servant in America. How many people can say that?</p>

                <p>JQA was the "principal architect" of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monroe_Doctrine" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Monroe Doctrine</a> as Secretary of State under President <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Monroe" target="_blank" rel="noopener">James Monroe</a>. He believed deeply in American independence and moral leadership on the world stage, but also in restraint and justice. He thought long-term and acted with principle.</p>

                <h2>Presidency</h2>
                <p>And then came the presidency. He won in what was essentially a four-way brawl—an election so messy it had to be decided in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_House_of_Representatives" target="_blank" rel="noopener">House of Representatives</a> (and gave rise to claims of a “corrupt bargain” when <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Clay" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Henry Clay</a>, Speaker of the House, supported Adams and was later named Secretary of State). That charge followed him for the rest of his term, even though there’s no solid evidence it was anything more than politics as usual.</p>

                <p>He only served one term, but not for lack of vision. His presidency was packed with forward-thinking ideas: national infrastructure, a national university, exploration and scientific advancement, even funding for the arts. He believed the federal government had a role to play in strengthening the country’s future—not just economically, but intellectually and morally. He pushed for roads, canals, schools, even a national observatory.</p>

                <p>But, as easy as that sounds, it was difficult for JQA to accomplish his ideas. Populism—the political movement that champions the “common man” over elites—was on the rise, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Jackson" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jackson</a>’s supporters painted JQA as elitist and out of touch. Worse, he refused to play the political game—he wouldn’t hand out jobs to allies or clean house of his enemies. He governed by principle, not popularity, and in Washington, that came at a cost. Still, reading about it now, it’s clear: a lot of what he proposed was ahead of its time. He saw what America could become, and tried to steer it in that direction—even when no one followed.</p>

                <h2>Real Life</h2>
                <p>Here’s the thing: Unger doesn’t shy away from the political losses, the frustrations, or the personal costs. But that’s what makes JQA admirable. He didn’t bend just to win. He spoke the truth, stood for what was right, and often paid the price. And then, incredibly, his story doesn't end with the presidency. And what fascinated me was, this book doesn't spend too much time on the Presidency. This is more about the man, than the office. As is most often about each President.</p>

                <h2>After Presidency</h2>
                <p>After leaving the White House, most former presidents retire quietly. Not JQA. He went back into public service—this time in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_House_of_Representatives" target="_blank" rel="noopener">House of Representatives</a>—where he served for another seventeen years! He became a relentless opponent of slavery and the “gag rule” that tried to prevent anti-slavery petitions from being heard in Congress. He fought for what was right, even when it made him deeply unpopular. Even when he stood nearly alone.</p>

                <h2>Faith and Character</h2>
                <p>And something I thought was incredible: JQA read the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bible" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bible</a> every year. He journaled, reflected, and committed himself to spiritual growth and moral clarity. He believed that liberty and virtue were inseparable. In a world where political ambition so often crowds out personal character, Adams was a man who kept both in view.</p>

                <p>He even served as president of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Bible_Society" target="_blank" rel="noopener">American Bible Society</a>, a role that fit him perfectly. He believed the Bible was not only foundational for personal morality, but also for the health of the republic itself. For JQA, the Scriptures were more than religious reading—they were a civic compass.</p>

                <h2>His Death</h2>
                <p>He literally died on the House floor—suffering a stroke in the Capitol while in the middle of serving his country. His last words were, “This is the end of earth, but I am content.” Whoa!</p>

                <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
                <p>If you’re looking for a biography that goes beyond just the office of the presidency—if you want to understand what it looks like to live a life of principle, service, discipline, and faith—John Quincy Adams is worth your time. Another great American Presidential Biography complete! That's the seventh biography that I've read now! Washington, Adams, Jefferson, Madison, Monroe, Grant, and now JQA!</p>
