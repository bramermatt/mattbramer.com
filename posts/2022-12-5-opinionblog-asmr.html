        <h2>This is Going to Sound Strange or SO GOOD</h2>
        <p>This could get very weird, but we're going to take that into consideration as I tell you about one of my most favorite things.. EVER. ASMR.</p>
        
        <p>If you talk about this at work, or really anywhere, be prepared to get made fun on!</p>
        
        <p>From <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASMR#:~:text=Autonomous%20sensory%20meridian%20response%20(ASMR,and%20may%20overlap%20with%20frisson." target="_blank">Wikipedia</a>, ASMR is: Autonomous sensory meridian response (ASMR) is a tingling sensation that usually begins on the scalp and moves down the back of the neck and upper spine. A pleasant form of paresthesia, it has been compared with auditory-tactile synesthesia and may overlap with frisson.</p>
        <p>ASMR signifies the subjective experience of "low-grade euphoria" characterized by "a combination of positive feelings and a distinct static-like tingling sensation on the skin." It is most commonly triggered by specific auditory or visual stimuli, and less commonly by intentional attention control A genre of videos intended to induce ASMR has emerged, over 25 million of which had been published on YouTube by 2022 and a dedicated category of live ASMR streams on Twitch.</p>
        
        <p>If that doesn't make sense, well I don't know how else really to explain it other than for most of my life some things would happen to me and I'd get this sense of <em>calm</em>, that's really what I get out of ASMR. Some people get different sensations, but this is something I found six years ago or so, and it has been apart of my daily routine since then.</p>
        
        <h2>ASMR I Like</h2>
        <p>As mentioned, there are different types of ASMR, that of soft-speaking, or mouth noises, or tapping sounds, or crunching sounds. It's probably what happens to you when you pop bubble wrap, you just don't know it!</p>
        
        <p>I've grown accustomed to enjoying watching and listening to ASMR Exams, and I'll give some examples in a moment. But, when you're getting examined and you feel calm or the doctor is speaking in a nice caring tone, you feel good. I haven't been to the doctor in a long time, but I LOVE WATCHING AND LISTENING TO ASMR Exams.</p>
        
        <p>This video in particular, if I can't sleep, I'll put a headphone in a listen to this. I don't have to watch it because I've seen it so many times, but I listen to this video <strong>all the time</strong>.</p>
        
        <p>I love these videos, they calm me down when I'm stressed out, they interest me, in knowing about these things, and I just love how they sound! It is so great!</p>
        
        
        <h2>From <a href="https://www.inverse.com/mind-body/asmr-sensitivity" target="_blank">INVERSE</a></h2>
        <p>DO YOU EVER experience a tingling sensation in your scalp when someone whispers? If you recognize that feeling, then you may well be acquainted with the phenomenon that’s gathered millions of followers over the last few years, and has been dubbed “autonomous sensory meridian response” (ASMR).</p>
        <p>For those of you who haven’t heard of ASMR, it’s a relaxing head-orientated tingling sensation that some people experience in response to various sensory “triggers”. It could be watching someone brush hair, fold laundry with care and expertise, or certain sounds like whispering or tapping. And in everyday life, one of the most common triggers is actually soft touch — like stroking someone’s arm or tracing fingers on the back.</p>
