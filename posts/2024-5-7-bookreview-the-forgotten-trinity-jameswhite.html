                <h2>Written Review</h2>

                <p>Started reading May 3, 2024. Finished reading May 7, 2024.</p>

                <p>A whole chapter on the Masterpiece that is John 1... NEED I SAY MORE?! Okay, I will. This book was incredibly enlightening. A very enjoyable and understandable examination of the Trinity and an explanation of the doctrine. Wow. </p>
                
                <p>This book gives a lot of evidence for the Trinity in the word of the Bible. You will be amazed in reading this book about how much the Bible really shows that. </p>
                
                <p>Something I've never really connected is that Christ - through and by Christ - all things are created. Christ as the Creator of All Things is something that I've not given much thought to, but it is VISIBLE when reading the Old Testament, specifically Genesis 1, and then reading the New Testament, specifically John 1. Then with the knowledge of the New Testament or even you could call it the Revelation of the New Testament. With the experience and knowledge of the learnings and teachings from Jesus and who Jesus is in his position in the Godhead, Triune God. Just awesome! You have to read this book. </p>
                
                <p>There is even a chapter on the Early Church and their thoughts on the Trinity and their thoughts on who God and Christ and the Holy Spirit are. I am so incredibly gratified, if that even is the right word, in reading this and revitalizing my understandings of the Bible and the deity of Christ. I am strengthened in my faith, in reading these theological books. I highly recommend reading books about the Bible, different perspectives, all of it. It will give your faith a firmer understanding and give Christ His Glory for you to learn more about Him. Ah, I'm just so incredibly excited to read more. </p>
                
                <p>This book was a little dense at points. I am not a theologian - I'd consider myself an "arm-chair theologian - and this book is a little heady, but you'll get it. You'll understand. There are hundreds of verses in this book that are exegeted (make sense of) and you will be AMAZED at where Christ is throughout the ENTIRE BIBLE. One I'll point out that blew my mind.. </p>
                
                <blockquote>"Another important fact to note from this verse is that if indeed no one has seen the Father, then what does this tell us of the Son? Who did Isaiah see in Isaiah 6? Who walked with Abraham by the oaks of Mamre (Genesis 18:1)? None other than the preincarnate Jesus Christ, the eternal Logos (the Word in John 1:1) ... all of which confirm and substantiate the proclamation of John 1:1-18: Jesus Christ is God in human flesh, the eternal Creator of all things, "the Only Son, who is God!"</blockquote>
                
                
                <p>In "The Forgotten Trinity: Recovering the Heart of Christian Belief," Dr. James R. White embarks on a profound exploration of one of the most foundational doctrines of Christianity. As the title suggests, the Trinity is often overlooked or misunderstood, yet it stands at the core of Christian faith and understanding. White's work not only illuminates the historical and theological significance of the Trinity but also offers invaluable insights into its practical implications for believers today.</p>
                
                <p>With scholarly rigor and accessible prose, White guides readers through the intricate terrain of Trinitarian theology, tracing its development from the early Church Fathers to contemporary debates. He unpacks the biblical foundations of the Trinity, demonstrating how the Old and New Testaments converge to reveal the triune nature of God. Moreover, White addresses common misconceptions and objections surrounding the Trinity, equipping readers with the tools to articulate and defend this central doctrine with clarity and confidence.</p>
                
                <p>Beyond doctrinal exposition, "The Forgotten Trinity" invites readers into a deeper encounter with the Triune Godâ€”a relationship marked by intimacy, reverence, and transformative power. White underscores the profound implications of Trinitarian belief for Christian worship, prayer, and community life, urging believers to embrace the mystery and majesty of God's triune nature in their daily walk of faith.</p>
