                <h2>2022 End of the Year School Update!</h2>
                <p>I am 38 Credits away from completing my Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science with a focus in Software Engineering!</p>
            
                <h2>Graduation Date</h2>
                <p>According to my advisor, I should be graduating in June of 2024. I started my degree track in June of 2019. That means, if I complete my degree with this track and no deviations, I will have been in school for 5 years. I've been going to school <em>part time</em> since 2020 so I imagine this is fairly normal.</p>
            
                <h2>Applied Linear Algebra</h2>
                <p>I just completed my Applied Linear Algebra class, and that was a very difficult class! All about vectors, matrices, constrained least squares, and so much more. Wow it was a lot for me, but I finished with a B+!</p>
            
                <h2>GPA so far</h2>
                <p>My GPA so far is 3.159, and I wouldn't be telling you that unless I was happy with it.</p>
            
            
                <h2>Next Class</h2>
                <p>Software Testing, Automation, and Quality Assurance! Here is the blurb.. "students will apply software engineering testing strategies and practices as part of the software development lifecycle, including requirements analysis, verification and validation, and quality management. The creation of unit tests and analysis of various testing approaches will also be covered." Nice!</p>
