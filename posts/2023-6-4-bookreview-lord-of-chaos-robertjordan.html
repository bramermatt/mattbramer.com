<h2>When I Started Reading</h2>
<p>I'm really happy to be back reading the Wheel of Time. Make sure to check out my <a href="../pages/wheel-of-time-in-review.html">Wheel of Time in Review</a>!</p>

<p>I am currently reading, as of May 2, 2023, so this is going to be a review in progress! And below, I'm going to have notes as I read, by chapter. More than likely spoilers, so I'm going to keep those hidden by the box below. When I've finished my read, the Notes box will be moved below the spoiler box, probably past the score!</p>

<blockquote>Matt with the Lord of Chaos</blockquote>

<h2 id="written">Written Review</h2>
<p>And here we are. Six books in and we keep building! Robert Jordan has outdone himself, these characters are so incredibly deep. The world is vast and the named characters are getting extravagant.</p>

<p>This book is a bit violent and dark. I’m so excited to continue this series! 9 more books to go!</p> 
    
<p>This is my favorite book in the series so far. There is a lot of story left, many story threads left open and there is a building of a villain coming back and so much more.</p>
    
<p>This, I believe is the longest book in the series, at 1,015 pages. It took me over a month to read, a lot of family things happening in that time, so it didn’t feel very long.</p>
    
<p>You’re going to love it!</p>

<blockquote>My New Favorite Wheel of Time Book! - Lord of Chaos Book Review (SPOILER FREE)</blockquote>

<h2>Spoilers</h2>
<p>Just a bit of preamble here.. the way this review will be is a lot of different from others. I'm wrote notes on every single chapter that I read. Which is completely spoiler, so this is where the spoilers start.. read at your own risk!</p>

<p>And now I'm adding in predictions for upcoming books and more! Check that out below.</p>

<details id="spoilers">
    <summary>Spoilers</summary>
    <p>There is a lot to cover in this book. 1,015 pages of story. Some parts of the book built things that seemingly aren’t going to be resolved for books to come, but other things were resolved or involved in this book! I also wrote this out of chronological order, I kept thinking of things that happened in this book!</p>

    <p>If you'd like a better summary, checkout <a href="https://dragonmount.com/Books/Lord_of_Chaos/summary/" target="_blank">Dragonmount's summary</a>!</p>
    
    <h2>Rand bonded by Alanna</h2>
    <p>Alanna is a Green Ajah who decided to bond Rand against his will. That was a sad scene for Rand. And I truly don’t know what that means for the two of them, or even Elayne who wants to bond Rand. Can he be bonded twice? Later we learn Alanna also wanted to Compel Rand to listen, she couldn’t because Rand was so strong. And a male channeler hasn’t ever been bonded before. I look forward to seeing what happens with this.</p>
    
    <h2>A lot of forsaken</h2>
    <p>From the very beginning of this book, we get a lot of Forsaken and it’s awesome! I love reading their perspectives, of these people that have been around for thousands of years and know things from the past and are also connected to the Dark One. We also got some Dark One this book. That was epic. I’m really interested in that I want to read more of The Dark One. These plots this book seemed to be a building plot, because nothing of this was resolved this book. There are still a lot of Forsaken out there. We even got Forsaken that we’re brought back to life in different bodies?! Whoa!</p>
    
    <h2>Rand’s amnesty with male channelers</h2>
    <p>This, I was excited about. Rand, being the Dragon Reborn, the Car’a’carn, and such, needs a lot of male and female channelers at his side when it comes time for the Last Battle. This is a great way ti start that. It’s also interesting that in the beginning of this book Mazrim Taim comes to Rand.</p>
    
    <h2>The black tower</h2>
    <p>For those wondering, this is not the White Tower taken over by Black Ajah, which is what I thought. Wow. This is what the male channelers that Taim has brought in with his recruiting are faking the place that they’re at, in the beginning of this book it was just called The Farm! And whoa is this incredible! At the end of this book, which I’ll talk about.. whoa, there are over two hundred male channelers that have been recruited. Rand and Taim want to match the White Tower by the end of the year (in book time). And from what I can see, I think they will!!</p>
    
    <h2>Asha’man</h2>
    <p>This is the highest rank of a male channeler at the Black Tower! This is an Old Tongue word that means guardian or defender of justice. Rand came up with this system. There will be levels, like the White Tower Aes Sedai, first is soldier, then Dedicated, and then Asha’man! I do find it interesting that Rand is completely separating themselves from the current White Tower Aes Sedai. Before all channelers were Aes Sedai. Interesting..</p>
    
    <h2>Egwene as Amyrlin</h2>
    <p>This was incredible as well! Wow, I really liked this book. So Egwene, and I’m jumping ahead, Travelled to Salidar through TAR and showed up and was raised Amyrlin in Salidar. Now, I look forward to seeing what happens with this because there are a lot of plotting going on around Egwene, there Salidar Aes Sedai want to control Egwene. I think they chose her because she could be controlled, but Egwene is not having it and it is AWESOME! Also, she raised Nynaeve and Elayne to full Aes Sedai. None of them have taken the Three Oaths yet. And I don’t know if they ever will! Also, Egwene as Amyrlin was part of Egwene’s Accepted test in, I believe, the Great Hunt. So it was partially foreshadowed from back then! Wow RJ. Also, Egwene and Gawyn love each other.</p>
    
    <h2>Perrin</h2>
    <p>Perrin is back! And Faile, and Gaul, and Bain, and Chiad! Perrin meets Faile’s parents and that goes poorly at first, and then they accept him. And now they want grandchildren. A lot of grandchildren. Perrin also is harassed by Berelain and Faile is super jealous and is mean to Perrin about her. And Perrin left the Two Rivers at the beginning of this book because he was feeling the taveren pull from Rand. Perrin also led an army at Dumai’s Wells, which I look forward to talking about.</p>
    
    <h2>Loial</h2>
    <p>He’s back! And we got to meet some important people in his life, this book. Elder Haman! Erith, an Ogier that wants to marry him. And Loial’s mom! They were great! They were dropped off at the Two Rivers to find Loial, but Loial turned up in Caemlyn.. so we’ll see if they ever reconnect. </p>
    
    <h2>Shadar Logoth</h2>
    <p>We also go to go back to Shadar Logoth with Haman, Erith, and Loial’s mom, and a lot of Aiel. Rand is under the impression that he needs to block off all the Waygates in the world. And these Ogier know where almost all are, even if they’re not on the map. So they all go to Shadar Logoth to block the Waygate and end up losing.. Liah an Aiel.</p>
    
    <h2>Nynaeve healing Logain and Siuan and Leane</h2>
    <p>YES YES YES! Nynaeve! So yes, Nynaeve healed Logain’s  gentling and Siuan and Leane’s stilling. Nynaeve is very good at Healing while using all, Spirit, Fire, Air, Water, and Earth. But for this Healing, Nynaeve used Spirit and Fire. And Logain is as strong as he was before he was gentled but Siuan and Leane were very weak in the power.. interesting. Also… Nynaeve now being raised to Aes Sedai chose Yellow Ajah! And Nynaeve still has a block where she has to be angry to channel. I hope she can break that soon.</p>
    
    <h2>Elayne Trikand, Green Ajah</h2>
    <p>Elayne chose Green! Elayne has made a lot of discoveries this book, with the help of Moghedien in Salidar. Moghedien was actually Marigan in Salidar using an inverted weave Illusion so she can’t be noticed. And at any point Elayne, Nynaeve, or then Egwene, we’re wearing the a’dam bracelet for Mogi. I digress, Elayne has been able to make an a’dam, and multiple copies of TAR ter’angreal rings so that people could visit TAR. I don’t have much to say about Elayne really. I was pretty hyped on Nynaeve this book.</p>
    
    <h2>Rand with LTT</h2>
    <p>LTT, are you really in Rand’s head? Oh wow. I really want to know if that’s true. Rand keeps trying to communicate with LTT, and we eventually get that small conversation while Rand is in the box. So I really don’t know! I want more, I want to learn more about LTT.</p>
    
    <h2>Rand and Embassies</h2>
    <p>Oh wow. Quick summary, Rand meets with embassies from Salidar and then the White Tower. A lot of posturing by all parties. Rand, from LTT, chose and requested on three Aes Sedai at a time so Rand couldn’t be taken advantage of and shielded. This was amazing hinting at by RJ, you just have to read it because in an early meeting Rand comes down from his throne and checks if everyone is Aes Sedai… such a good book.</p>
    
    <h2>Rand was kidnapped</h2>
    <p>So eventually the White Tower Aes Sedai Embassy (including some Black Ajah) came to Rand and it turned out to be 15 Aes Sedai (THATS A LOT) and they shielded him and kidnapped him and shoved him into a box. Now, there are some awful scenes coming up with Rand being tortured by the Aes Sedai. First off, this is Rand’s fault because he had a LOT OF AIEL TO PROTECT HIM, but he asked them to stay away. So when Rand was taken, no one knew where he was, for a long time. This was hard to read, the way they were torturing him by folding him into the box and hitting him with Air all over his body to make him feel like he was burning. Whoa. A terrible picture. RJ seemed to take some from the POWs in Vietnam when he was a helicopter gunner. This whole real ending was many aspects of war. Wow. Brutal.</p>
    
    <h2>Min</h2>
    <p>She’s back! She also kisses Rand a lot lol. And Rand thinks she’s just a good friend. Then Min gets captured as well. Rand breaks out of his box and breaks the shield with the “help” of LTT? Wow. It was definitely an act of love from Rand going after saving Min. Wow. Beautiful.</p>
    
    <h2>Rand’s Mother and Father</h2>
    <p>Rand found out his parents were Tigraine (daughter heir) and Tarangail Damandred. It has been something that we have been trying to figure out since The Eye of the World! I’m so glad we finally got an answer to this. Also, Rand was worried that he was related to Elayne, because he loves her. Turns out they’re not related.. woo!</p>
    
    <h2>Morgase</h2>
    <p>Morgase is still around. Currently hanging out with Pedron Niall in Amador. She recently signed a document Pedron Niall asked her to sign, which gives the Whitecloaks a headquarters in Andor and they can never be asked to leave, they also can police their own law, not that of Andor. A hefty document. Also, Patir from The Eye of the World is dead.</p>
    
    <h2>Ebou Dar</h2>
    <p>Ebou Dar is where Nynaeve, Elayne, Birgitte, Thom, Juilin, Mat and the a few of his men are currently at. This is a dangerous place with a ter’angreal that will supposedly change the weather, the Cloud Bowl, as that’s all we know the name of it as. We left that crew in a place called Rahad, a dangerous place in Ebou Dar where supposedly this bowl is. It’s also very hot, because the Dark One has control of the weather, so we’ve been told.</p>
    
    <h2>The Aes Sedai kneeling to Rand!</h2>
    <p>This, after reading Dumai’s Wells was insane. Wow. Rand did it, he made these Aes Sedai from Salidar kneel to him and now we are going to see those ramifications. They kneeled to the Dragon Reborn, will they serve him? We’ll have to wait and see. WHOA! SO GOOD!</p>
    
    <h2>Seanchan</h2>
    <p>The Seanchan are coming back! I’m so excited! We got hints and hints of them in this book, and the epilogue showed a character who is Seanchan excited for there Return… here we go!</p>
    
    <h2>Mat</h2>
    <p>Mat is awesome. There was a very funny scene with Mat after he got to Salidar and was telling Nynave, Elayne, and Egwene not to play with the Amyrlin’s stole and that this Salidar Amyrlin was a fake because this isn’t the White Tower, and then… Egwene is the Amyrlin Seat here and Mat gets caught with his mouth hanging open.. very funny stuff. Mat helps this boy Olver and Mat enlists him as his messenger. I like this connection, Mat and Olver. Mat is becoming more and more General Cauthon and I LOVE IT! He has these voices in his head, which we really didn’t get much of this book, I’m interested to get back to that. But I love Mat and I’m excited to read more about him. He’s so funny.</p>
    
    
    <h2>Dumai’s Wells</h2>
    <p>Wow, how do I begin. “Asha’man kill”, “human meat grinder”. This was a long, long, lead up after being in Rand’s head for his torture and his dealings with the Asha’man to that point. Rand asked them to be literal weapons for him.. and they are. They absolute massacred the Shaido. I mean, decimated them. And that is their role. It was a brutal and horrifying read, but it was amazing too. After thinking Rand was going to be taken to the White Tower by these horrible Aes Sedai, and after all the build up of these Asha’man, we get Rand breaking out the box with LTT’s help, him saving Min, and then seeing the carnage from all the Aes Sedai, Aiel, Cairhien, Perrin and the Wolves, Loial, and so many people. Amazingly well written and understandable battle. It was insane.. oh I want to read it again right now. SO GOOD. I’m very interested to see the implications for that - the male channelers being unleashed, the Aes Sedai kneeling to Rand, and the LTT in Rand’s head. So much more to learn about.</p>

    <p>These are responding to my predictions from The Fires of Heaven.</p>

    <ul>
        <li>
            <h2>Moiraine</h2>
            <p>There was no Moiraine this book, but I'm still holding out!</p>
        </li>

        <li>
            <h2>Perrin in LOC</h2>
            <p>Well yes, there was Perrin back in Lord of Chaos! Not very much in this book.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
            <h2>Nynaeve</h2>
            <p>Nynaeve didn't break her block yet! And Nynaeve did choose the Yellow Ajah!</p>
        </li>

        <li>
            <h2>Stilling and Gentling</h2>
            <p>Whoa, yes we did get Still and Gentling Healed, but I'm so interested in learning more about this because Nynaeve only used Spirit and Fire and Siuan and Leane aren't as strong as they were before they were Stilled.. hmm.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
            <h2>Rand and LTT</h2>
            <p>We got more of Rand and LTT, but I still really don't know what is going on. Maybe it's just that Rand is going mad. But, LTT and Rand sort of communicated while Rand was in the Box... I am ready to read more about this!</p>
        </li>

        <li>
            <h2>Warders</h2>
            <p>I haven't gotten a true answer on this, but I do believe this is true "anyone can be a warder", since Mat was asked to be a Warder... hmm.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
            <h2>Morgase's Compulsion</h2>
            <p>We got no answers on this in Lord of Chaos.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
            <h2>Saidin</h2>
            <p>There is some worry about going mad from Saidin, because of the taint. Taim and others haven't gone mad for years, but we don't know how they've done that. I'm very interested to learn more about that.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
            <h2>A'dam</h2>
            <p>Elayne was able to copy more and create a'dams from this bracelet. Neat!</p>
        </li>

        <li>
            <h2>Mogi</h2>
            <p>Mogi was Marigan! WOW!</p>

<details id="spoilers" style="border-color: rgb(27, 86, 105);">
    <summary style="background-color:rgb(27, 86, 105);">Notes As I Read</summary>

    <h2>Prologue, The First Message</h2>
    <p>Good gracious. Not only do we get a Forsaken perspective - Demandred, we get more of Shayol Ghul, the Pit of Doom, Thakan’dar, HOLY SMOKES. We also get the GREAT LORD OF THE DARK TALKING TO DEMANDRED?! AHHHH! And how Thakan’dar blades are made… by murdering people?! Golly! AND THE BORE?! AND THAT THIS IS TODAY… A DAY AFTER FIRES OF HEAVEN! I AM FREAKING OUT!! This is amazing!! And Nae’blis… one step below the Great Lord huh? Interesting.</p>

    <p>Oh, and a Nynaeve perspective.. yay! Okay, a lot here. Nynaeve is working hard at figuring out how to Heal stilling and gentling, and she is justifiably weary of Healing Logain’s Gentling. Mogi was actually Marigan from the boat! Fascinating! Stilling is something that has been cut or torn (Severed as Mogi called it). And the weather huh? The Dark One’s doing.</p>

    <p>Next is an Elayne perspective. And boy, I like Elayne too... oh and Min! Hey, I knew Elayne was going to do something with the ter'angrael.. and she did! She was able to copy it from the a'dam! That's crazy awesome! I also love that they are learning things from Mogi (another teacher from the AOL!!). I appreciate Mogi being complicate, well as much as she can be since she's collared.. haha! But I look forward to seeing Min meet up with Rand. And what the heck is the Dark One doing with the weather!</p>

    <p>I don't know if I've said it yet... but I love Perrin, and I love Faile. I also love Loial. I'm happy about this crew. Oh this was a great perspective.. Faile! She's great! I appreciate that she is taking to this Lady business as Perrin doesn't want to be around. I love the fact that a lot of people are coming to the Two Rivers and Emond's Field. That's great! Oh and Perrin needs to go to Rand... YES! I can't wait. Are we going to get Min getting to Rand and Perrin getting to Rand this book?! I CAN'T WAIT! Interesting Verrin and Alanna are gone.. I guess they are going to Salidar? And wait.. is Alanna the Green that is bonded to Lan now?? I can't seem to remember. This is going to be a huge book.</p>

    <p>GAWYN NO! Dang it.. this peddler has started something that I am not looking forward to. I hate that Gawyn now wants to kill Rand when he's on his way with six Aes Sedai to capture Rand. This is not going to be good. I can smell it. Not good. My prediction is Rand won't be able to kill Gawyn but Gawyn will try to kill Rand, but the Maidens will kill Gawyn, and try explaining that to Elayne, Rand! OH THIS IS GOING TO STINK! Also, for note taking.. Corien is the "leader" of the Aes Sedai, and Elaida told him nothing. Gotta be a Black Ajah plot right?? Oh no! But, there were only six Aes Sedai.. we might be okay.. might be. And these sneaky Shaido Wise One's hmm..</p>

    <p>Katerine Alruddin, good gracious.. BLACK AJAH PLOT! There are so many people that want to kill Rand right now. OH NO. Okay, I have to put this in more for me than anything.. okay Aes Sedai agelessness again. "Galina Casban looked forty at most, but that was twice Katerine's true age". No thoughts, just adding it to my notes. This is getting deep knowing now that this group's mission was not Elaida's and this was completely Black Ajah plot! WHOA!</p>

    <p>Sevanna (COULADIN'S WIDOW).. this strange wetlander hmm. Forsaken, gotta be, or Fain. What's this box?? This Prologue is DEEP.</p>

    <p>MORGASE... PAITR IS A DARKFRIEND! I'm glad we're getting a Morgase perspective, and now she knows Gaebril/Rahvin is dead. Will she be going to Ghealdan like Tallanvor wants? Who knows.</p>

    <p>Pedron Niall, a sneaky Sonofagun.. And we get Carridin.. sorry, Bors! Not looking good. Now this Guaire Amalasan, interesting Worldbuilding. Niall doesn't want any Children to go to Salidar. Okay, onto the next!</p>

    <p>Masaana the Forsaken! YES! I love it when we get Forsaken in cahoots! I find it.. interesting, that when Masaana went to the Pit of Doom the ceiling was shorter - so that it brushed her hair. Maybe this is insignificant, but maybe it's not. And interesting that the DO didn't say anything to her. AND interesting that these Forsaken are looking for angreal and sa'angreal AND interesting about this Statis Box.. what the heck is that?! AND THAT HAS THE BE THE BOX THAT SEVANNA HAS, AND THAT HAS TO HAVE BEEN A FORSAKEN THAT GAVE THE BOX TO SEVANNA! Also, who is the Lord of Chaos?!</p>

    <p>Osan'gar / Aran'gar.. pardon me.. what? Is this one person or two?! This raises so many questions.. why can't men touch Saidar? why can't women touch Saidin? Could this amalgamation of a human touch both halves? what the heck is this thing?? And we get Shaidar Haran again... interesting.</p>

    <h2>Ch 1, Lion on the Hill</h2>
    <p>A wind rises in Cairhien. Alright, this is good. Rand is hearing more and more of LTT in his head.. I WANT MORE OF THAT!! Alright, Egwene is in Cairhien. Rand is still in Caemlyn. Rand has a plan to take Illian, plan from Mat + Bashere, but of course more Mat than Bashere! This is so good. ALso, Bashere's nine thousand horses includes nobles and officers AND THEIR WIVES... I definitely think Faile will want to go with Perrin everywhere - because this is Saldaen culture. And lastly.. we get Mazrim Taim entering the Palace.. WHOA!</p>

    <h2>Ch 2, A New Arrival</h2>
    <p>Mazrim Taim.. man I feel exactly as Rand does here. I'm worried not to trust Taim. And it is quite possibly because Rand isn't the only male channeler. But Rand needs help, or at least he will for the Last Battle. I just don't know. Getting some funny feelings from Taim. I appreciate there is a name for Rand's Seanchan spear.. The Dragon Scepter. And where is Rand going to take Taim?? lol</p>

    <p>Also, anyone going to mention Asmodean?</p>

    <h2>Ch 3, A Woman's Eyes</h2>
    <p>I love this. 27 possible male channellers in the few weeks since Rand has called for them. That's good. Feels like a very insignificant number. I hope more come and I expect more to come as well. Not sure how, but I'm sure there might! Rand is pretty strong. I so badly want to trust Taim. And YES! We get Rand thinking that Asmo fled - glad it's been acknowledged. And LTT, whatcha doin' in there? And Taim can hold as much as Rand can.. well well well. Interesting. I want Rand to be the most powerful and I have heard he is.. I'm just really jealous that someone might be close to Rand in power. AHH TAIM! Also, I love Rand opening gateways!</p>

    <h2>Ch 4, A Sense of Humor</h2>
    <p>I am so interested in Aiel humor lol. I don't get it at all, and I hope I do one day. Alright so we've got Hearne, Simaan, Darlin, Tedosian, and Estanda rebelling against Rand and have gone to Haddon Mirk. I appreciate that Rand is choosing to ignore that for now.. that's for future Rand. Rand has a lot on his plate! Also, Rand being called Lord of the Morning.. nice! And Rand hasn't heard LTT since he told him to "shut up". I find that....... interesting. I will keep an eye out for that. Also, Rand has been using TAR!</p>

    <h2>Ch 5, A Different Dance</h2>
    <p>SHEESH. I. LOVE. MAT. This is so great. Alright, a lot here in 30+ pages. Mat and the BAND OF THE RED HAND, that is freaking awesome. I love Mat. I am so interested in Mat's memories and Mat's Luck. so much of that is barely explained, and I'm so read to learn more. I really think it's awesome that Mat is Mat. He is like no other main character here. I am interested in what the Horn means to / for Mat now, just a lot has happened and he doesn't have it, and he died. So is it still linked to it? I love Mat and Betse, that's sweet. I'm interested to know why Mat has memories when dancing... interesting. Also, anytime any character cares for someone less fortunate puts me in my feels, Mat and Olver is great. It makes me very happy. AND Mat and the Red Hand moving to Tear.. interesting, is there just going to be an absolutely massive army to attack Sammael in Illian? That'd be neat.</p>

    <h2>Ch 6, Threads Woven of Shadow</h2>
    <p>Before I read... this is my new favorite chapter symbol and chapter title. Without a doubt, I'm here for it! WOO! Sammael, are you my favorite Forsaken? Interesting. This was an awesome perspective. I love seeing the Forsaken interact and I'm so interested in all these Old-Tongue words: jegal, choss-hauler, conje. Also, is Graendal talking about Shara?! That's pretty neat. I'm going to write these words down to remember.. Sh'boan, Sh'botay. I find it interesting that Sammael won't call Rand LTT.. why? Here we go! And the ILLUSION! That's the holding of the image when Graendal was using to make herself look different. Very interesting.</p>

    <p>Graendal.. golly. She’s cunning and smart. Lady Basene. Okay, I have no idea who that is. I’m sure we’ll find out! Very interesting - this whole thing. And what has Mesaana bound? Semirhage?</p>

    <p>And Semirhage.. she scares me. She seems so smart and so ready to be able to do SOME HARM. And yes, I believe the other Forsaken also very bad, but these Forsaken that we've recently heard from are just very scary. And let's talk a bit here. Shaidar Haran, I'm with Semirhage - what is he?? WHY IS HE SO DIFFERENT. Also, interesting that the Forsaken don't understand the Warder bond. And Semi has killed the Warder. And this Aes Sedai is Cabriana Mecandes. Okay. I will continue to say Lanfear and Moiraine are not dead.</p>

    <h2>Ch 7, A Matter of Thought</h2>
    <p>TAR. Hey, I'm a happy Matt here, but I'm also a little confused. But I think I get it. So, someone dreamed this nightmare and it became real. Someone stepped into it and was sucked in. But to get rid of the nightmare, the Aes Sedai had to concentrate on what was real. FASCINATING. Alright, we're back with Elayne, Nynaeve, and the Salidar crew. Cool. A lot of info in this chapter, catching us up on the bits and bobs of Randland. I do have a prediction: is Shemerin... Mesaana? The Accepted that fled? Because the Dark One called her back to Shayol Ghul? That's my prediction! And whoa, Demandred knows that Elayne is Elayne and that she is using a mirror ter'angreal. That's a lot. WHO IS THE LORD OF CHAOS?!</p>

    <h2>Ch 8, The Storm Gathers</h2>
    <p>First off, title of the chapter... the Storm Gathers... kinda like The Gathering Storm?? Huh?? Book 12?? huh?? Anyways lol.</p>
    <p>I. LOVE. NYNAEVE. I have said it before, and I will continue saying it. I love Nynaeve. My love for her started in the Eye of the World, because I thought of her as a bit of a Hagrid Character (sorry for the shot for the Harry Potter reference), but I thought of her as a bit of a terciary character that I enjoyed being around, and then as her character grew I really really enjoyed reading her. My love for her was brought up 10-fold when she got Birgitte brought into the real world. When she was crying and sad and hurt so much for doing that - that's when I knew I loved Nynaeve. I want nothing more than to see Nynaeve happy and doing anything she puts her mind to. I want that for Nynaeve. I don't care how she gets that - I want that for her. I love her.</p>

    <p>Also, I love that RJ capitalizes Listening to the Wind.. so good. Alright, let's try to figure this all out - there was a lot in these 27 pages. I appreciate Theodrin and her wanting to help Nynaeve with her block - me too Theodrin.. me too. But I thought that was an endearing story and I can safely say I don't think that Theodrin is a darkfriend - there was a thought of that, but now I'm fully on board with her not being a darkfriend.</p>

    <p>Salidar is packed. Good. I appreciate that the Aes Sedai are recruiting! WOOP! MORE NOVICES IN SALIDAR THAN IN THE TOWER.. WOOP!</p>

    <p>Oh boy, Tarna Feir of the Red Ajah from the WHITE TOWER... OH BOY!</p>

    <p>I'm tucking away Nynaeve's sense of the bad weather lasting for days. I'll keep that in mind... hmm. I LOVE NYNAEVE!</p>

    <h2>Ch 9, Plans, White Cloak Sunburst</h2>
    <p>Alrighty, Pedron Niall, I've said it before and I'll say it again.. Pedron Niall, is a sneaky Sonofagun. He is ruthless and has a lot of power behind him. I really enjoy seeing his perspective but he has a lot of agents at his disposal to do some damage! Things could get rough. The Four Rumors.. 1. Black Ajah started the upheaval of the White Tower. 2. Black Ajah have control of the White Tower. 3,4. Aes Sedai in Salidar are petiioning for forgiveness and denouncing themselves as Aes Sedai. Interesting.</p>


    <h2>Ch 10, A Saying in the Borderlands, The Dragon Icon</h2>
    <p>RAND HAS BEEN BONDED?! BY ALANNA?! Golly. I have zero idea what that is going to mean for Rand + Elayne + Alanna. How can Rand break this bond? Does Rand need to break the bond? Is this a good thing? Why did she do this?! Dude. This is crazy. Also, Rand is super t'avaren and so much is happening around him. WHAT DOES THIS BONDING MEAN?! Also, Rand figured out how not to be hot lol.</p>

    <h2>Ch 11, Lessons and Teachers, Dragon Fang Icon</h2>
    <p>Okay, so that's how Moiraine made herself look gigantic in TEOTW.. Air and Fire in an Illusion! I've been wondering that since then! How did she do it! And okay, I do not at all give any aquiecense to Alanna here, because she bonded Rand against his will. Even if her Warder died, she had no right. Maybe she was being selfish, but she sounds a lot like a Red with "men channelers loose on the world?! NO WAY!". I do not like Alanna.</p>

    <h2>Ch 12, Questions and Answers, Tar Valon Icon</h2>
    <p>Neither saw the woman watching them from a second-story window. Spooky. </p>

    <p>Oh my Nynaeve. I don't like how Mogi is putting in thoughts in Nynaeve's head.. at one point literally says "Moghedien was right."... NOT GOOD NYNAEVE. I don't know if Nynaeve, Elayne, and Birgitte are going to leave Salidar. That's interesting. I can't believe that they'd be able to leave without being noticed. That isn't going to be good for them. Thom and Juilin still aren't back.. hmm. Delana and Janya are questioning Nynaeve on Rand - I recently feel like everyone wants to trap Rand. At least in these last two chapters, Aes Sedai want Rand and they want him badly.</p>

    <p>For this eavesdropping stopping ward is... Fire + Air with touches of Water. Neat!</p>

    <h2>Ch 13, Under the Dust, Snake Icon</h2>
    <p>First off, why the Snake icon?? Is it because something is going to happen in Ebou Dar?? I don't know! Honestly, I thought this chapter was going to be Nynaeve breaking her block! I want that so badly. Nynaeve keeps saying "Moghedien is right".. I don't like that! That shouldn't be the case, Mogi is bad news! How would this crew go to Caemlyn unnoticed? And this Tarna... hmm... she has me thinking..</p>

    <p>Let's talk TAR! Alright. Love the *shift*! Also love this *Need* in TAR. Very interesting. I'm interested in this weather ter'angreal! I wonder if this would be able to control the weather EVERYWHERE! Probably not lol. It is 2 feet across, but I just don't know! I also love Elayne thinking she knows everything about everywhere they go.. "you'd like the Ebou Dari Wise Women Nynaeve.." lol.</p>

    <h2>Ch 14, Dreams and Nightmares, Dreams Icon</h2>
    <p>I feel Egwene in this chapter, not knowing is tough! Not knowing when you desprately want to know.. that's tough. I feel for you Egwene. You're silly for this whole chapter, absolute a silly Dreamer here thinking you can go around TAR and not have any consequences. Who are these women.. A copper skinned woman in Tar Valon, and a handsome woman in the White Tower and the Heart of the Stone AND in Caemlyn. Who could it be?! Heck.. Brett and Dani in podcast ep. 609. These women are Siuan and Leane.. duh lol. She doesn’t recognize them because of the agelessness!</p>

    <p>Let's talk Gawyn. What just happened?! So this is Gawyn's dream. Okay, why did it pull Egwene in? Maybe if someone dreams of YOU and you're in TAR or with the lights, whosever dream is dreaming of you, you get pulled in? That sounds a bit farfetched, but I wouldn't be surprised. And they definitely made love. But WHAT DOES THAT MEAN IN TAR?! WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?!</p>

    <p>Now onto Nynaeve's perspective. Oh wow.. that was interesting! A bubble of evil eh?? Very interesting that Anaiya doesn't believe about the bubble of evil and why she requested a Linking?? And she was disappointed that this wasn't a Forsaken attack.. INTERESTING!</p>

    <h2>Ch 15, A Pile of Sand, Aiel Icon</h2>
    <p>Oh Egwene, your dreams mean so much! Don't think so little of them! Of course, I have no real idea what they mean either, right now, but they mean a lot you DREAMER! Since Lanfear's attack Egwene has headaches after visiting TAR.. does that have something to do with Lanfear's connection with TAR? Or could it be just the part of the brain or the power (lowercased p) that Dreamers have or those Dreamwalkers have to enter TAR could be injured or severed in some way? Like, could Egwene lose the ability to enter TAR if she were "injured" more? HMMM. Okay, so let's talk these dreams..</p>

    <p>Gawyn shutting a door on Egwene and she was dead.. I'm writing that down to look back on that one. I imagine Egwene might die at somepoint. But at this point we've seen people die and they're able to come back so.. we'll see! Perrin and the wolf and hawk and falcon... Berelain and Faile! Mat with two ravens on his shoulders... interesting. Elayne forcing Rand to his knees with one hand.. bonding? - can multiple people bond the same person???? Elayne, Min, and Aviendha in a circle around Rand... oh oh! And Rand walking toward a burning mountain (Shayol Ghul), crunching the Seals! THIS ONE I CAN'T WAIT TO SEE PLAYOUT! Egwene, stop lying to the Wise Ones. Also, I am soooo interested in the ages of Aes Sedai!</p>

    <p>Nynaeve.. THAT WAS AWESOME! Silly, but that was AWESOME! Way to bring it to the Little Tower where it hurts them, their fear. I mean, it's true. They're scared and they don't know otherwise. They think they know what to do, but when the going gets tough.. they've got nothing! Oh that was awesome. Silly, she's absolutely going to regret that, but awesome. And this ter'angreal needs a man to channel - ah but it was a lie. so, okay.</p>

    <p>Elayne.. haha I love that line "Elayne sneezed, banging her head on the side of the overturned caldron", what a line after Nynaeve's outburst. And Elayne swears that she will go to Ebou Dar, find the ter'angreal and use it to tie the Salidar Aes Sedai to Rand. Number 1, I have no idea how, but I'm here for it!</p>

    <p>And lastly Sheriam, what does Carlinya mean that less than two dozen Aes Sedai know what is really going on.. going on about what??</p>

    <h2>Ch 16, Tellings of the Wheel, Forsaken Icon</h2>
    <p>Dear Lord. THIS IS GOING TO BE A GOOD BOOK! I keep going back and forth on this statement.. this has been my favorite chapter of the book so far. Maybe it was the realization of Rand's parents after so much build up from TEOTW.. so good to see Rand hear it from Dyelin. I truly didn't think we were going to get that yet, but there it was and WOW. To see it written is absolutely amazing! SO GOOD! Makes me want to reread TEOTW again.. lol I surely will. Also, makes me want to reread TEOTW for Moiraine.. oh Moiraine, I miss you! My prediction has been and will stay: she's not dead. I don't know when we'll see her next, but she's not dead! THIS WAS SO GOOD. Also, isn't Moriaine Damodred? So, just for my sanity.. we've got DAD - Taringail Damodred, MOM - Tigraine (daughter heir.. last name unknown to me) / Shaiel... children - Rand and Galad. So Moiraine is related to Taringail? Or maybe I'll RAFO and hey, I'm happy to RAFO! But Laman was also a Damodred.... whoa. A lot. I love this chapter. I love this book. I love this book series. WHOA! HERE WE GO!</p>

    <p>Also, yes Rand, DO NOT TRUCE A FORSAKEN! And wink wink, Aviendha biting her lip thinking of Rand. And Rand is putting off "watching the cavalry". Okay. NEXT!!</p>

    <h2>Ch 17, The Wheel of a Life, Dragon Icon</h2>
    <p>Good gracious.. MANGIN. That was so hard to read. He knew he did wrong, did it anyway, and came clean. That is powerful and hard and sad. Oh Rand. That was tough. Where did Avihenda go?? Very interesting these Cairhienin people attempting to twist Aiel ways. I appreciate where Rhuarc is coming from. And I don’t agree with Berelain (I DO NOT LIKE HER). Not that I don’t trust her, I just don’t like her. Oh oh Shara! Fighting in Shara! What’s going on with the Sea Folk?? Hmmm.</p>

    <h2>Ch 18, A Taste of Solitude, Cairhienin Icon</h2>
    <p>Rand orders Berelain and Rhuarc to hang Mangin tomorrow, then he leaves for his school. This is great! So cool. Getting to see all these things that we know of in our world being made here... so cool! Alright, I love this Herid Fel fella. Really interesting stuff about the Last Battle and the Wheel of Time. This is great! And the chapter isn't even over! I think I might need to nail down some predictions about what the Last Battle will be.</p>

    <p>Um Egwene.. you're being judgmental. Lol. I just feel like Egwene thinks she's so much better than everyone else. It's odd to see her and Rand interact now. I don't like when she's angry with him lol. I like to see this ta'veren pull on people, I see how hard it could be for people to realize what's happening for the pull. I agree, what are these Salidar Aes Sedai not coming to Rand? What will happen if Rand knows where Salidar is?</p>

    <p>Oh heck, Rand, this is going to go poorly for you, letting the Maiden's by the wayside just so you can have some solitude. THIS WILL BE BAD FOR YOU!</p>

    <h2>Ch 19, Matters of Toh, Caemlyn Lion Icon</h2>
    <p>Hey, cool! I love these bits of AOL with the sho-wings and cars. They're cool. Although, very interesting that Rand is seemingly having LTT's dreams now? That doesn't sound like that is a good thing... I'll have to RAFO! Interesting dreams these Wise Ones have. Rand on a boat with three women (Elayne, Min, and Aviendha I'm guessing) or maybe its Alanna and some others... interesting. And a scale titling hmm.. Maybe I agree with Rand on his interpretations of these dreams, I like to see people say their interpretations whether or not I agree with them. It's helpful to have a starting point on making sense of these prophetic dreams. And Rand telling LTT to shut up again.. hmm.</p>

    <p>Aviendha.. oh Aviendha. I love that she was able to hand-talk with Liah with "I have toh" and she replies "very small, spear-sister"... ahhh so sweet. I love it! And what the heck is this about killing Rand??? Can anyone explain without spoilers lol?</p>

    <h2>Ch 20, From the Stedding, Avendasora(?) Leaf Icon</h2>
    <p>I have so many thoughts. Oh, do I love the Ogier. I love them so much. They are perfect. I want to spend so much time with them and learn so much more of how they work! This was a beautiful chapter. I felt so much when Elder Haman was marking the Groves and Steddings of those they lost... so sad. This was awesome - finding out about more Steddings and Waygates! I look forward to a *safe* Waygate travel.. with no Black Wind... spooky. </p>

    <p>Question: Will we get an updated World Map at the beginning of A Crown of Swords with the Steddings or no? I'm really interested in that actually.</p>

    <p>OH BOY WE ARE GOING BACK TO SHADAR LOGOTH! I'M SO EXCITED! THIS IS GOING TO BE TERRIFYING! </p>

    <p>Questions: Are they going to Gateway there, or is Rand just Travelling now, capital T? Because he technically *knows* where he is at. But the Skimming is when you ride through the Gateway and it takes a while, Travelling is walkthrough and you're there right?</p> 

    <h2>Ch 21, To Shadar Logoth, Ravens Icon</h2>
    <p>This book, specifically these recent chapters, have been such a nostalgic ride from everything we've learned so far since TEOTW. SO MANY FEELS! How did Liah die? Or did she even die?</p>

    <p>Interesting about LTT talking in Rands head.. how they can almost communicate. I would **hate** this, because this wouldn't be what I want at all. If LTT really wasn't communicating with Rand and this is just Rand going mad from the taint on saidin. The idea that LTT isn't actually in Rand's head, that's what I **don't** want. I **want** LTT to be in Rand's head. I don't konw how that works or why that's something that I want, but I want that to be true, that somehow and someway Rand will be able to communicate with LTT. That is what I want.</p>

    <p>Oh Rand nearly back to Emond's Field.. sad. I miss Loial.</p>

    <h2>Ch 22, Heading South, Dice (Mat) Icon</h2>
    <p>HERE WE GO! This was great! I love when Mat gets to fight with his staff - he's great at it! Now, really, some Aiel killed these Tinker's? And this was a Forsaken that sent these Aiel... but who. I really don't know, because all these Forsaken are against each other some trying to pretend that Sammael sent seom Aiel when it was actually another.. I'll be interested to find out who actually sent these.. And Olver is here, now being Mat's Messenger! And he gets his own horse! THIS IS SO GOOD.</p>

    <h2>Ch 23, To Understand a Message, Forsaken Icon</h2>
    <p>Graendal and Sammael..nice. Sammael seems to think he is going to have a statis box (box from AOL) and he thinks there are angreal there too. UH OH! So he thinks Rand accepted the Truce? I do believe he was lying. Interesting that this jumara / Worms in the Blight. Mesaana in the White Tower. Graendal doesn't know where Demandred or Semirhage are. I think Semirhage is still at Shayol Ghul? Short chapter.</p>

    <h2>Ch 24, An Embassy, The Flame of Tar Valon Icon</h2>
    <p>Mangin was hanged off screen. Okay, so that happened. I trusted it would, because I know Rand and those he has put in commanding positions are true to their word. Sucks it was Mangin, but it happened. Egwene is told she can return to TAR, even though she has been without anyone's permission. There are a lot of rumors about the Aes Sedai splitting. And then five or six Aes Sedai come to greet Rand, these Aes Sedai are believed to be from the White Tower Embassy. Rand isn't in Cairhien. Egwene runs to meet the Wise Ones and Berelain is there, so Berelain needs to go meet this embassy. Egwene goes back to her own tent, but is too tired to visit TAR (good you shouldn't yet!) and she ends up dreaming of Gawyn.</p>

    <h2>Ch 25, Like Lightning and Rain, Caemlyn Lion</h2>
    <p>Egwene's perspective.. boy do I love love for these characters. Everyone. Nynaeve and Lan.... ooooo where is Lan?? Is he close to Salidar? Perrin and Faile, love it. Rand and Elayne, love it. Rand and Aviendha, love it. Egwene and Gawyn, love love love it! Gawyn is such a sweet sap and it's so good to see, he really loves Egwene. And I love Egwene saying that she is going to Bond Gawyn. ALSO ALSO, Birgitte and Uno... love it! haha. Okay, so these Aes Sedai.. if I recall, these are BLACK AJAH right?? From the Prologue? hmm what are they channelling?</p>

    <p>Katerine, and Nesune perspecitves.. what the heck is going on?! Katerine is Black Ajah, BUT WHAT COULD SHE BE PLANNING?!. It is interesting that they have this plan that someone else will neeed to rule Cairhien... hmmmm.</p>

    <p>Lastly Sarene Nemdahl.. that's what the channeling is! The practicing with a lot of saidar! And there are more Aes Sedai coming to Cairhien! Aracome is still working Berelain... hmm..</p>

    <h2>Ch 26, Connecting Lines, Whitecloak Icon</h2>
    <p>Holy smokes this chapter blew up! First off, what the heck are Bashere's men doing? Why are they hand-standing on their horses? What are the white stones so close apart?? THEN HOLY SMOKES THESE PEOPLE TRY TO MURDER RAND IN DIRTY WHITECLOAK UNIFORMS?! And Desora is killed... so sad. And more Aiel dead too. These are, I believe just standard Darkfriends but their wearing Whitecloak uniforms that I cannot remember who those people were. And how Rand deals with these people is awesome. So powerful making the guy ride to Niall. Wow!</p>

    <p>Then back in the Palace a Wavemistress wants to talk to Rand, nice. I wonder what that’s all about. </p>

    <p>And then! Awesome Andor history that I look forward to Brett recapping for me in the podcast! But Rand is safe, he is not a cousin to Elayne.. 😂😂😂😂. So good. </p>

    <p>What’s in Cairhien, why would Rand go there??</p>
    
    <h2>Ch 27, Gifts, Dragon Icon</h2>
    <p>Egwene perspective. Hey, I’m glad we got some Aes Sedai talking with Rand! That was awesome to see. I appreciate Rand going at them with “do not channel near me, do not even embrace the True Source.” SO GOOD. So powerful, Rand. I love the conversation with Rand and Egwene. I know Egwene doesn’t, but it’s good for them to talk. I also loved Rand explaining his Traveling with the bending of the Pattern… but right, what does he Bore into?? Hmmmm. And Egwene sees Rand talking to LTT but she doesn’t know who and she thinks he is going mad. Hmmmmm. Onto the next perspective.</p>

    <p>Nesune (BROWN AJAH), and if you couldn't tell she was Brown, read this perspective again. This was fun! I love being in a Brown's head. Interesting that Nesune could sense Egwene.. I imagine that will be important. And they believe it could be Moiraine still alive.. I agree she still alive but they're wrong! It was Egwene. And I guess in the Royal Library, it was probably Egwene and someone else? Maybe.. not sure. Nesune wants to write a paper about Rand. </p>

    <h2>Ch 28, Letters, DAGGER ICON</h2>
    <p>Rand: well. A lot about toh, Sulin in a dress, Gray Man, Taim talking about a new recruit Jahar Narishma, LTT wants to kill Taim, Rand thinking about Sammael's defenses, Aviendha lecturing Rand about toh, gai-shain taking away the Gray Man as Rand is laughing, letters from Sea Folk asking for Rand, Rand making a light with Fire and Air (that's so cool). Now to a FAIN PERSPECTIVE?! OH NO!</p>

    <p>Fain: good gracious.. GROSS FAIN! Okay.... so how and when did Fain bond Rand? How did that happen? Was it because of The Ways? Fain is becoming more Mordeth with these *tricks*.. interesting. So he needs to touch his victims.. so don't let Fain touch you! And Fain has only a few Fades, Trollocs, and Whitecloaks and a few Darkfriends in Caemlyn and coming from Tar Valon. Fain can also sense Darkfriends, that's pretty cool. And gross he goes to rape this poor woman. GROSS!</p>

    <h2>Ch 29, Fire and Spirit, Wheel and Snake</h2>
    <p>HOLY SHOOT! NYNAEVE!! WOOOOOO! Healed Logain with Fire and Spirit.. the hole she found in Logain. HOLY SHOOT! Also, Thom and Juilin are back and the Little Tower want to talk to them. HOLY SHOOT NYNAEVE. Y'all are hating on my Nynaeve, she's great! Also, Nynaeve got drunk and I appreciate her apologizing. Also also, Thom heard Morgase is with the Whitecloaks.. she is! And Elayne thinks she's actually dead. OKAY READING ON! HOLY SHOOT!</p>

    <h2>Ch 30, To Heal Again, Flame of Tar Valon</h2>
    <p>Nynaeve healed Siuan and Leane! WOO! Oh that's so awesome. And Logain, I think I've said this before, but he is SCARY! I have literally no idea what he is capable of or what he would do if he even had an inch of power over these Aes Sedai.. WHOA! I'm also VERY INTERESTED if they can break Nynaeve's block! That would be great! Also, yes, I see what the Aes Sedai mean by her needing to keep scrubbing pots.. lol. Next perspective!</p>

    <p>Confused. Also, I hope to get more info on this Warder bond business, since Siuan is feeling for her Warder Alric now. But why aren't they as strong as they were? Cofused! And Siuan and Leane are going to go talk to the Sitters to see if they're Aes Sedai again, and Siuan thinks she should be reinstated as Amyrlin.. I don't see this going well. Also, are Siuan and Gareth Bryne going to be in love?! OH BOY lol. ALso, a quick perspective switch over to Ealyne without a page break.. hmm.</p>

    <p>Elayne. So Siuan and Leane *will be* Aes Sedai again. Siuan sticking with the Blue Ajah, and Leane going to petition to join the Green... hmm! Do you *have* to be Green if you want more Warders? I feel like there is a lot more to that then just Green (the multiple Warders). Just interesting to me. And interesting that Siuan and Leane aren't as strong as they were.... AND! Interesting about this hierarchy business with how strong the Aes Sedai is in the One Power. Next perspective! </p>

    <p>Delana Mosaline perspective. WE HAVE A FORSAKEN IN SALIDAR... well, a second Forsaken.. where the heck is Moghedien? Would somebody put a leash on her! Okay, so we've got Aran'gar, which my thought was Aginor! OH WOW THIS GOING TO BE BIG! And Siuan wants to join the Wise One TAR meetings. </p>

    <h2>Ch 31, Red Wax, Whitecloak Sunburst Icon</h2>
    <p>Eamon Valda, I'll give this to the Whitecloaks, they have quite possibly the coolest names of any places. The Fortress of the Light.. the Dome of Truth. Whoa! Albeit that they remind me of Nazi's, that is not good at all. Horrible actually. So there's that. And Valda doesn't like Morgase being there. Got it. And so strange, they'd hang someone after they're dead. And there sounds like there might be a bit of a coup amongst the Whitecloaks with Valda against Niall.</p>

    <p>Niall, sneaky sneaky! I love to get a Niall perspective.. I don't love Niall, I just love to get to see through his eyes. And more notes. And Niall has a *feeling* that something is happening. Agreed, Niall. </p>

    <p>Oh Morgase, well we lost Patir (darkfriend) and her escape plan.. okay, onto the next. Now, this Treaty that she signed. HMMMM. It is going to take a LONGTIME for her to undo this, and I really can't even picture how this will all playout. THIS IS CRAZY. Also, love the "do you play stones?" and aw "she had had the best teacher in the Game of Houses" THOM! Okay, onto the next perspective. </p>

    <p>Asunawa didn't know that Patir was connected to Morgase.. interesting. AND Asunawa has an elaborate trial planned for Morgase.. uh oh. And he hopes she continues to resist Nial so he can extract a confession.. for her as a Darkfriend? </p>

    <h2>Ch 32, Summoned in Haste, TAR Icon</h2>
    <p>Oh boy things are about to POP OFF! So Egwene just thought she could climb up a Sea Folk ship?? Odd. And then she just picked them up and dunked the Sea Folk. And they said “no disguises will let you in these ships”. So someone else was trying to get on there before. Also, HOLY HECK, Egwene is about to be raised as Amyrlin. WHOA! Why? How? Why her? Is it her? They’re summoning her to Salidar… but why?? Hmm.</p>

    <p>Also, BOOM RAND KNOWS WHERE SALIDAR IS! This is going to be so good. </p>

    <p>Tucking this away, because we keep hearing about it: going into TAR in the flesh doesn’t seem to be good. But I think Rand does that every time he goes in. Right? He Gateways in. Hmm. CRAZY!</p>

    <h2>Ch 33, Courage to Strengthen, Aiel Icon</h2>
    <p>Here we go. Egwene says she's figured out Traveling in TAR on her own.. nice! She is telling all the lies she's told the Wise Ones... good Egwene. And now she needs to ask a favor to meet her toh.</p>

    <p>Now Rand wants Mat to get Elayne AND Egwene, and he wants Mat to bring Aviendha. I'm struggling because I am interested in this Aes Sedai Salidar plot, but I am afraid Mat and Rand are going to ruin those plans! WHAT IS GOING TO HAPPEN?!</p>

    <p>Egwene has more toh to give.. even if she thinks its over. But here we go. Egwene is nearly ready to go to Salidar. Wow. It feels like we are building to something big. And It *is* sad we are leaving the Wise Ones. </p>

    <h2>Ch 34, Journey to Salidar, Flame of Tar Valon Icon</h2>
    <p>Holy smokes, jeez. This happened so fast. I can't breathe, this was great. What?! AH! WOW! Egwene, whoa, slipped into TAR with a Gateway.. WHOA. Then came very fast with TAR Bela, then got to Salidar in hours. Then boom, that's Siuan, she back but weak. THEN BOOM. YOU... ARE TO BE THE NEXT AMYRLIN SEAT?! AHHHHHHHH I NEED TO READ MORE!</p>

    <h2>Ch 35, In the Hall of the Sitter, Wheel and Snake Icon</h2>
    <p>Good Gracious. HOLY SMOKES. I AM SCREAMING RIGHT NOW. THIS IS SO FREAKING COOL. OH MY GOSH. THIS IS SO AWESOME. AHHHHHHHH. EGWENE AL'VERE IS THE WATCHER OF THE SEALS, THE FLAME OF TAR VALON, THE AMYRLIN SEAT. SHEESH. I'm so happy right now. This is crazy! What a journey!</p>

    <h2>Ch 36, The Amyrlin is Raised, Flame of Tar Valon</h2>
    <p>I appreciate that the Aes Sedai literally raise the Amyrlin on Air.. haha. Okay, this was a good chapter. Sheriam is Keeper.. nice. Novices and Accepted are absolved of their penances.. nice. Theodrin, Faolain, Nynaeve, and Elayne are raised to full Aes Sedai! WOW! That is awesome! Interesting, the ramifications of not taking the Oath Rod and having the follow the 3 codes (what is that called?). Interesting the Salidar embassy is almost to Caemlyn WOO! Egwene thinks her being raised is just for show because of Rand and how she thinks the Aes Sedai will try to use her... I sadly agree the more I read the ways the other Aes Sedai are treating Egwene. And Nynaeve and Elayne want to go to Ebou Dar for this bowl and Egwene thinks she can show them her *Traveling* in TAR. Sweet!</p>

    <h2>Ch 37, When Battle Begins, a'dam icon</h2>
    <p>Egwene figured out Gateways nice! Elayne and Nynaeve admited concealing Mogi (that's good!). Egwene doesn't want to ask about Birgitte. Egwenes intends to unite Wise One channelers and Aes Sedai and Sea Folk Windfinders. Disguises and Inversion is discussed. Egwene gets the a'dam. Oh, Mogi was shocked by the mention of Ebou Dar... interesting! Siuan arrives and they get to talking about Siuan giving advice to Egwene. I LOVE IT!</p>

    <p>Romanda.. sneaky sneaky. Romanda was going to be Amyrlin.. but Egwene was supported soley to keep the stole from Lelaine... sneaky! She thinks raising the Accepteds (Theodrin, Faolain, Nynaeve, and Elayne) was Sheriam's idea. And she's wondering about where Delana is... I KNOW! SHE'S WITH BATHAMEL / Arangar!</p>

    <p>Oh, a lot of perspectives this chapter.. Lelaine thinks just the opposite of Romanda... Egwene was raised to keep the stole from Romanda! And people are wondering where Delana is.. BATHAMEL / Arangar!</p>

    <p>Delana, yes is with Aran'gar. Okay, so Halima / Aran'gar / Bathamel, is a woman now (loc prologue). But they can channel saidin.. right? That's what I'm reading? Because Delana thinks Helima can't channel, but Helima knows when Delana is channeling because of the goosebumps!</p>

    <p>Yeah Siuan! I agree, Egwene will be a very strong Amyrlin! And Siuan tells Lelaine that Romanda is bothering Egwene insisting they stay in Salidar.</p>

    <p>Oh heck, they're starting rumors! </p>

    <h2>Ch 38, A Sudden Chill, Dice (Mat) Icon</h2>
    <p>Oh yeah, this was great! Mat thinking he knows everything, taking Egwene's stole off and being thek same Mat as before... hilarious! I love Nynaeve and Elayne's reaction to Mat doing that... stunned silence and Elayne's eyes nearly popping out of her head... hahahahah. Now, why aren't there flies in Salidar? Have we heard that before? It was interesting Mat talked about it. Mat's foxhead medallion goes cold when Egwene channels at Mat... THAT IS INCREDIBLE! I want to know more about that, but we've been getting bits and pieces of it, but I'm excited to learn more. I love this chapter. This was so funny. I love Mat staring openmouthed when they call Egwene "Mother". Ha!</p>

    <h2>Ch 39, Possibilities, Wheel and Snake</h2>
    <p>We are *building*! Something is going to happen and it's going to be BIG! Alright, Egwene wonders if Rand knows she Traveled to Salidar, Mat go to see Thom, Elayne goes to find Aviendha, Elayne wants to learn more about Mat's ter'angreal medallion, Elayne and Nynaeve plan to join Merilille in Ebou Dar.. one thing I found interesting was the Ebou Dar has the Throne of the Winds... hmm.. winds.. Wind Bowl.. hmm. </p>

    <p>Egwene is convinced Birgitte is the real Birgitte, Nynaeve talked with Janya about lost Talens... including Aligning the Matrix (making metals stronger), and there is no knowledge of Spinning Earthfire or Milking Tears. Egwene, Nynaeve, and Elayne now know about keeping cool in the heat! Egwene can Travel in the waking world now.. that's awesome! Romanda wants to gateway to the White Tower to steal the Oath Rod and *certain items* for the Aes Sedai ceremony. Egwene also thinks Rand might bring some of his channeling men to Salidar. So there was a lot in this chapter. </p>

    <h2>Ch 40, Unexpected Laughter, Gleeman Icon</h2>
    <p>Mat gives Thom letter. Mat doesn't know but this letter should be from Moiraine. My expectation is this letter are the Red Sisters that Gentled Thom's nephew... Owen? ..looked it up how silly am I to spell it that way it's Ow*y*n lol. Thom's nephew who could channel! That is my expectation of the letter, or some love between Moiraine and Thom.. rafo. Now, Thom, Julin, Elayne, and Nynaeve **are** going to Ebou Dar. What will Mat do? Follow? HMM. Mat sends Vanin back to tell Talmanes to wait. All is going *according to plan*.</p>

    <p>Elayne perspective. Alright! I'm jumping ahead but we get the truth.. Aviendha laid with Rand and now Elayne knows! Crazy how this *toh* works and how Elayne could've killed Aviendha here, whoa! Elayne now realizes that Aviendha is Min's third woman.. we've known that for sometime now, very cool to see. Very interesting, I've come to accept this sister-wife situation with Rand since we've heard so much about Aiel and that. Min should be arriving in Caemlyn about now, sweet. And again, the chapter title is the last few lines of the chapter.. interesting. Okay, so Birgitte doesn't want Egwene to know she *is* Birgitte. Because she thinks people will expect so much from her, being this hero. AHA Elayne has chosen Green! We still don't know what Nynaeve has chosen, but I'm guessing yellow.</p>

    <h2>Ch 41, A Threat, Caemlyn Lion</h2>
    <p>Min! Min is in Caemlyn, love this. Min and the Salidar embassy are in Caemlyn, but Min snuck out to see Rand.. And she's seeing Rand! I love Min. Okay, Enaila's viewing.. a wreath of some sort, hmm, bridal wreath? Min sees Rand and her heart is beating out of her chest... and viewings! Countless thousands of sparkling lights, like stars or fireflies, rushed into a great blackness, trying to fill it up, rushed in and were swallowed. There seemed to be more lights than she had ever seen before, but the darkness swallowed them at a greater rate, too. UMM TAR? Like the inbetween the dreams place with all the dreams, maybe? And an Aura of yellow, brown, and purple... I have zero idea. And Rand walks to Min smiling! WOO! HERE WE GO!</p>

    <p>Rand perspective. Ah nice. For some reason I want Rand to love Min back. I'm worried that won't happen, but we've got time (9 books!). Uh, Melaine is pregnant with twins that Min views, and Melaine will name one after Min (nice). Got the Salidar embassy coming to Rand, and Rand wants them to come in threes because LTT thinks he can handle three at a time. Not much communication between LTT and Rand as of late. And Rand and Mina re alone again and it feels awkward to Rand. Probably because Min loves Rand and they literally had a conversation where Min was on Rand's lap lol.</p>

    <p>Okay, a couple of notes:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>We seem to be stalling this Sammael battle, we haven't heard of that in a while (one mention this chapter). </li>
            <li>Where is Lan, why hasn't he arrived yet? </li>
            <li>Where is Perrin? </li>
            <li>Loial, I haven't heard from you in a while. You okay?</li>
            <li>What are the Forsaken doing, haven't heard from them in a while?</li>
            <li>Holy smokes the next chapter is called **THE BLACK TOWER** AH! WHAT?!</li>
        </ol>

    <h2>Ch 42, The Black Tower, The Dragon Icon</h2>
    <p>I am of two minds here. First off, I love this. This is amazing, and I'm so excited to see how this Black Tower builds! WOO! Second, I am really trying to be on Taim's side. He's done nothing that I can think of that would concern me, but he is a strong male channeller. I just don't know! Okay, let's talk about the Asha'man! Okay, so Rand tells the hundred male channellers they will be the Black Tower (Rand doesn't like that name), and they will have levels like the Aes Sedai. First level, soldier. Second level, Dedicated. Highest level, Asha'man which in the Old Tongue translated loosley to "guardian or defender of a just cause"... that's awesome! Love the Old Tongue use. Taim receives the sword pin as Dedicated then the dragon pin as Asha'man. Rand says "he guesses he (Rand) was the first Asha'man". Rand and Taim go to the farmhouse and talk, Taim thinks he will have a thousand male channellers by the end of the year! WOW! But Taim is shaking with rage at Rand because Taim is worried about the Aes Sedai in Caemlyn. Rand is yelling at LTT, but it's outloud. Here, Taim redeems himself a bit for me, because he tells Rand that he needs to keep hold of his sanity. Then Taim suggests "accidents" for some Aes Sedai to kie. Rand will kill Taim if that happens, Taim asks if Sammael or Damandred decides to kill the Aes Sedai and Rand tells Taim that he hope that does not happen. Rand also intends to teach the Aes Sedai to dance to his flute.. where is his flute (Rand's thought). WOO!</p>

    <h2>Ch 43, The Crown of Roses, The Caemlyn Lion Icon</h2>
    <p>Aha, so Rand met the Salidar Embassy! Nice. Wow, these Aes Sedai are sneaky. Very cool to get a Grey's perspective. And whoa, Merana is old.. but how old?! she's been an Aes Sedai 80 years, but I don't know how old she was when she became Aes Sedai. She was an Aes Sedai for 30 years when Alanna was born.. how old is Alanna?! Okay, I'm in the weeds. So, Alanna wants to weep when she Delves into Rand's side-wound from Ishamael... interesting!! Verin is also much older than Alanna. HOW OLD ARE AES SEDAI?! Next perspective. </p>

    <p>A quick Dyelin Taravin perspective. She's meeting with Kairen, have we met Kairen? Dyelin is worried about Elayne, and Kairen implies that she might help while Rand might not......</p>

    <p>Luan Norwelyn perspective. Lord Luan. HMM. Luan meets with Rafela and Rafela says that Andor will be better offi if Rand leaves it in peace and unity...</p>

    <p>Ellorien Traemane perspecitve. What the heck is going on?! SNEAKY SNEAKY PEOPLE! Demira Sedai.. hmm. They talk about who will have the Lion Throne if Rand leaves.</p>

    <p>ALSO.. Discord Channel Name!! WOOT! The Crown of Roses!</p>

    <h2>Ch 44, The Color of Trust, Forsaken Icon</h2>
    <p>Whoa! A hefty Mat perspective here. Love this. Okay, so Mat being Mat so stubborn haha! Okay, so Mat is dancing with Halima (Aran'gar / Bathamel) and when he leaves Halima, they channel. We know that because Mat's medallion goes cold, but he can't see the weaves obviously, but it's because Halima is channelling saidin! WHOA, crazy! Mat doesn't recognize Birgitte... still. Myrelle offers to bond Mat as Warder (multiple times), she also asked if Egwene bonded him yet. Mat asks Siuan to dance (he doesn't recognize her), and then Leane dancing with him and gives him a kiss. Olver named his horse Wind! Mat got five bonding offers, the first is Delana. My thought is Halima (etc) want to know why Mat couldn't be channelled at! Now, we're going to Ebou Dar! Let me see if I get this right.. Mat, Thom, Juilin, Elayne, Nynaeve, Vandene, Adeleas, Jaem (Warder) and a dozen cavalyrmen are going to Ebou Dar! Also, I love Mat bowing and kissing Egwene's ring. Mat also asks Talmanes to follow the Salidar Aes Sedai if they leave. Mat still doesn't think any of these Salidar Aes Sedai going to the White Tower is a good idea.. bad idea Mat thinks. Elayne also tried to open a gateway but it closed. We are riding to Ebou Dar!</p>

    <p>Elayne perspective. Egwene hopes Elayne and Nynaeve can keep Mat out of trouble.. hey, Mat can get himself out of trouble thank you very much Egwene! For some reason Egwene needed to get Mat away from the Band of the Red Hand.. interesting. OHHHHH Siuan left hints for Vanin to find that they are preparing to move, and they hope Mat left the right instructions for Talmanes. OH WOW. THEY ARE GOING TO THE WHITE TOWER. OH HECK! And this Ebou Dar crew are going to join Lord Bryne. </p>

    <p>So, this crew *is* going to Ebou Dar? And the Salidar Aes Sedai *are* going to the White Tower? Which means, they're going to use the Red Hand Band to help them... maybe. Maybe. </p>

    <h2>Ch 45, A Bitter Thought, Wolf Icon</h2>
    <p>OH HECK YESSSSS PERRIN IN CAEMLYN! OH WOW WOW WOW. THIS IS GOING TO BE SO GOOD. Heck yes. I'm so excited. This was an incredible way to introduce this RJ.. superb writting. Wow. Beautiful. </p>

    <p>Whoa. Okay, Aram wants to kill.. badly. Okay, so Vilnar and Perrin are introduced and VIlnar asks that Perrin limit the number of soliders in the city based on Bashere's and Rand's request. Dannil and Aram take the Two Rivers men and make camp west of the town. Gaul, Bain, and Chiad head into Camelyn on their own. Perrin and Faile get to Rand, and Min. Faile is jealous of Min! Probably just jealous of all women who fawn over Perrin, understandable. Also, Loial needed to go a stedding to rest, I really hope Loial is okay. I'm concerned for him. Also, also, Haman and Loial's mom are going to miss Loial in the Two Rivers.. oh no! Lol. Rand and Perrin catch up and Rand asks Perrin to go to Tear for him, being that Perrin would be in no danger and now the fourth person to know the plan. Perrin declines but Rand could gateway Perrin to Tear today. Rand says the Aes Sedai are trying to manipulate Rand.. so many Aes Sedai are trying to manipulate Rand. So good to get a Perrin perspective.. I've missed you Perrin.</p>

    <h2>Ch 46, Beyond the Gate, Flame of Tar Valon</h2>
    <p>The meeting the parents for Perrin. This was scary! lol. My experience with meeting the parents was **very** different than this. But it sounded so real, wow. But as Davram mentioned, no Faile never mentioned any "Broken Crown" (I'm interested in that!). Then Perrin stands up to Davram, whoa that was intense. Then Perrin meets Lady Bashere and wow. This was carzy, but luckily the Basheres accept Perrin as Faile's husband. Phew.</p>

    <p>Rand perspective. Min is coming nearly everyday to Rand to mention what she views in her viewings. Min blurts out that perring has "found his falcon and I wouldn't be surprised if she kills him when the hawk appears", which leads into Min telling a very scary viewing of Rand and Perrin with these floating lights. Rand thinks he understands it, but Min says it will happen either way. LTT is getting more and more persistent in Rands head. </p>

    <p>Demira Eriff. What the heck?! Okay, so Shaido? Sneaky Shaido? Are they coming back to attack? Also, she says that cats seem to sense Aes Sedai and not be afraid.. okay? Is that true? Okay, so these Aiel stab her with a spear and then she is stabbed again. A man with black eyes says something to her. That's the end of her perspective. Dead?</p>

    <p>Perrin. Oh wink wink, Perrin and Faile trying to make babies. I love how Perrin accidentally breaks buttons off and hides them like Faile won't notice haha! And oh oh, Faile won't answer about the "broken crown", and Faile knows some Maiden hand-talk.. sweet! Rand has left the Palace. Faile suggests that she spy on Rand, Perrin disagrees. </p>

    <p>Demira is not dead! Cool. But who were these Aiel that tried to kill her using the words, "tell the other witches to stay away from the Dragon Reborn"?! Also, they plan to punish Rand by ignoring him. Demira is upset that her reasech on the seals is postponed. </p>

    <p>Whoa, this ramped up. These Aiel have me so puzzled.</p>

    <h2>Ch 47, The Wandering Woman, Dice Icon</h2>
    <p>We are so close to Mat realizing who Birgitte is... so close! And that leads to, is Mat still the Horn sounder since he died in FOH?? Okay, big crew here, and I enjoyed this chapter. A lot of walking, talking, description. Amazing. Mat, with his medallion on, can have things thrown at him with the Power, just not touched with the Power (I think I've thought that previously, probably not). Elayne also really wants to study the medallion, Mat says no. Mat learns about the Marriage Knife and how Ebou Dar deal with displeasure (wives killing husbands if they're displeased). Mat learns, as do Vandene and Adeleas, that Elayne bonded Birgitte as Warder. Mat feels the dice tumbling when they meet Queen Tylin Quintara of House Mitsobar who rules from the Throne of the Winds. He doesn't want to stay there, so he chooses an inn across the square and it's the Wondering Woman, also Mat got really drunk. At the end of the chapter when Mat walks into The Wandering Woman, the dice have stopped tumbling.</p>

    <h2>Ch 48, Leaning on the Knife, Wheel and Snake Icon</h2>
    <p>Nynaeve, Elayne, Birgitte, and Aviendha are in a sitting room in the Tarasin Palace. Adeleas and Vandene supposedly intend to look for White Tower runaways. Mat is still a nuisance, but their task is to find the Cloud Bowl ter'angreal. Birgitte says AOL things and Aviendha wants to know what she's talking about, so Birgitte tightens up her talking about AOL things. Elayne and Nynaeve talk with Queen Tylin, Birgitte and Aviendha go scouting. Jaichim Carridin and the Whitecloaks are in the Palace, they sent an embassy months ago. WE HAVE AGES! Nynaeve is twenty-six and Elayne is 18. Elayne apologizes for Gareth Bryne's army and that puts them in the Queen's good graces. Elayne talks about the Cloud Bowl to the Queen and its apparently in Rahad (across the river). The bay is full of Sea Folk ships. Elayne bets they will find the bowl in ten days.</p>

    <h2>Ch 49, The Mirror of Mists, Cairhienin Sun Icon</h2>
    <p>Rand. OH SWEET! LOIAL! Oh such a happy reunion, Rand had to go and mention Loial's mom, Elder Haman, and Erith HA! Loial definitely loves Erith, but he doesn't want to be stuck in Stedding Shangtai. Prediction - they will get married, but she won't hold him to the stedding. Rand also asks Loial to help him find and put guards at all the Waygates. Perrin and Rand are MAD! Perrin is concerned that Rand is using all his friends, and I think Perrin is completely justified here, but it has to be done. Next, Min comes in a panic, the Aes Sedai are coming, the Aes Sedai are coming! The Caemlyn Aes Sedai (7) are coming now, after days of silence, since Demira was stabbed (Rand doesn't know that). They enter the Grand Hall, but Rand gets there first with a hundred Maidens. Rand also has his coat with the fat man angreal. The Aes Sedai spinning the *Mirror of Mists*, the Illusion to make you look very tall. Rand recognizes it, as does LTT in Rand's head. Demira wants to no longer agree to Rand's restrictions, but Rand channels Spirit, Fire, and Earth and breaks their Illusion. Rand tells them no and dismisses them.</p>

    <p>Min. Another viewing of brownish yellow and deep purple aura... uh oh. AND THIRTEEN AES SEDAI?! So Min did watch the Aes Sedai and Rand talk. Min gallops back to the Royal Palace on Wildrose to warn Rand!</p>

    <p>Rand. BUILDING TO SOMETHING HUGE. This is about to be insane. Rand knows there are thirteen Aes Sedai coming for him. Rand thinks to go to Cairhien. Rand goes to Perrin's quaters and everyone writes letters to their people. Faile (parents), Loial (Erith), Rand (Taim and Merana). Rand warned Taim of the 13 Aes Sedai. Nandera brings five hundred other Maidens (YES!). Rand and crew Travels to the Sun Palace in Cairhien, Rand is so exhausted from holding onto Saidin that Loial has to carry him to his rooms.</p>

    <p>Merana. "They were speaking of her Warder, after all." YEESH. That's Rand! They were talking to Alanna, wow. THIS BOOK HAS BEEN CRAZY SO FAR! Okay, Rand told them he was going to Cairhien, they guess he's discovered Travelling. Okay. Plans are changing. Demira has an informant near Rand and has confirmed that Rand has gone... who is the informant! Verin apparently guided Demira into the confrontation with Rand.. hmm. Alanna tried to compel Rand but it didn't work, she mentioned its because no one has ever bonded a male channeler.... oh oh! What will happen when Elayne tries to bond Rand.. oh oh! Okay, Demira, Valinde, Kairen, and Berenicia will take the Two Rivers girls to Salidar. The rest of the 13 will go to Cairhien. There is already the Elaida White Tower Embassy in Cairhien... WE ARE BUILDING!</p>

    <h2>Ch 50, Thorns, Wolf Icon</h2>
    <p>Rand. Hey, we stopped building lol. Not really, just doing some world building for what's going on in Cairhien right now. Min's viewings.. Colinda: she wouldn't say.. I wonder why not. Berelain: man in white will make her fall head over heals - prediction Galad! Rand goes to the school with Min, Herid Fel leaves note: Belief and order give strength. Have to clear rubble before you can build. - hmm. Herid *goes fishing*... suspicious! More Min viewings, Maringil: die by poison, Colavaere: die by hanging, Meilan: die by knife, Aracome, Maraconn, Gueyam:  die bloody deaths in battle. 10 days pass for Rand, good days he thinks.</p>

    <p>Perrin. And now, Berelain and Faile are not having a good time. There is an Aes Sedai in the Ryal Library, making Perrin nervous. Perrin goes hunting with Gaul or Rhuarc. Then Faile is mad at Perrin because of Berelain and she sleeps in a thick nightgown. Perrin doesn't know how to solve his girl problem.</p>

    <p>Rand. 10 more days until Merana, Alanna and crew will reach Cairhien. I'd love it if Rand would just bounce back and forth as to not get close to the Aes Sedai, that'd be funny. Rand is going to meet with the White Tower Embassy again, only three at a time. Here we go.</p>

    <h2>Ch 51, The Taking, Women Icon</h2>
    <p>OH SHOOOOOOOT! 15 Aes Sedai sheilded Rand... OH NO. They say "the Red Ajah are in charge", but this crew were some Black Ajah.. OH NO NO NO!</p>

    <p>Bain. The Aes Sedai tell them Rand has *left*. OH NO NO NO NO.</p>

    <p>Perrin. Perrin! Someone, help Rand! Help!</p>

    <p>Rand. oh man. Twelve rotate now holding his shield. He can feel siz soft points on the shield. Rand hopes Amys or Bair or some women who can channel will happen by or notice all the channeling. oh no no no.</p>

    <p>Sorilea. OH NO NO NO. This was built up so well. The Aes Sedai channeling so much before, making now nothing different. NO NO NO!!!!</p>

    <h2>Ch 52, Weaves of the Power, Dice Icon</h2>
    <p>Mat. Mat is gambling in The Wandering Woman, Mat mentions (after losing a game of dice) the Daughter of the Nine Moons and a blue-eyed, narrow-faced man chokes. I'm saving that note for later! Vanin reports the girls vanished from the Tarasin Palace again. They've been here for 10 days. Mat and his men head for Rahad to search for the girls. </p>

    <p>Elayne. Nice. Jumping around here, Birgitte thinks Mat is the more dangerous of the two, a N'Shar in Mameris.. no idea what that means. Elayne hopes Egwene found a solution. Elayne and Birgitte are wearing Power disguises, Aire, Fire, and Spirit to hide her channeling. 11 days searching for the bowl, Elayne lost the bet. Asra tried to Heal a man dying, and Elayne wants to follow her. Nynaeve thinks the bowl is in a five-story building. </p>

    <p>Egwene. Oh heck, I missed this a few chapters ago but Nynaeve has chosen Yellow Ajah! Elayne has chosen Green! WOO! Okay, Egwene is talking to Logain. Six Aes Sedai shield him while two Warders stadn guard outside. Egwene asks Logain about Rand's amnesty and he is ANGRY. Logain has channeled for six years without going mad. This crew has been moving north through Altara for sixteen days. Bryne's camp surrounds the Aes Sedai camp and Talmanes keeps the Band camp behind ten miles. A big army. Egwene enters TAR and talks with Nynaeve and Elayne. Egwene tells Elayne that Rand is in in Cairhien.. we know he's being shielded! OH NO RAND. Elayne asks for Egwene to pass a message to Min about Aviendha. Nynaeve asks about Lan. Egwene wakes and talks with Siuan and confirms her order to arrange for Logain to escape. Too many people want him gentled, Delana wants him killed (Halima really). </p>

    <p>Myrelle. LAN LAN LAN LAN! What is Myrelle planning? Nisao is with her and she's worried they will be exiled if anyone finds out what they are doing. Lan arrives. Myrelle uses Spirit on the bond to force him to come to her. She wonders how she can keep him alive long enough... long enough for what?!?!?! LAN YES!</p>

    <h2>Ch 53, The Feast of Lights, Caihrienin Icon</h2>
    <p>Perrin. RJ is amazing at writing, this world building wiht the Feast of the Lights at the shortest and last day of the year. It has also been six days since Rand *disappeared*. Min is gone still too. The Aes Sedai left for Tar Valon three days ago. The things Min viewed are coming true, of the nobles and their deaths. Berelain comes in with Rand's sword and beslt and they all realize Rand has been kidnapped. Sulin is getting her cadin'sor back! Rharc reluctantly admits only the siswai'aman and Maidens will fight Aes Sedai, and Sorilea says the Wise Ones will fight. And Dobraine says he will bring 500 men. BIG BIG BIG.</p>

    <p>Galina. OH NO MIN! THEY HAVE MIN! And Rand killed two Warders because they took Min. Whoa. There are 33 Aes Sedai in the camp.. whoa. Nine Green, Thirteen Red, and the rest White. Gawyn is there with the Younglings. Galina wants to gentle Rand on the spot, but she has other orders... OH BOY. They also want to keep Rand in this box.. ouch. </p>

    <p>Rand. Oh whoa! This was **hard to read**. Okay, Erian is flogging Rand with Air because the Warders Rand killed were Erians. Then Rand sees several Wise Ones there... only to find out it's Sevanna (Couladin's widow). And she traces her finger around his throat and Rand assumes she means to behead him. They put Rand in the box and Rand talks to LTT and LTT actually carries on with Rand. LTT telss Rand that he cannot break through the shield while it is actually being held, but can undo the knots inf they are tied off. WHOA!</p>

    <p>Galina. Their plan is to kill Gawyn.. no! So we're two weeks from Tar Valon. She plans to beat Rand every morning and night so he will be docile when they arrive to Elaida. NOOOOO!</p>

    <p>Alanna should be feeling this torture.. I wonder how that's going for her?  </p>

    <p>Sevanna. WHAT?! CONFUSED! Okay, Sevanna confirms that *her* Wise Ones can duplicate the Aes Sedai's weaves that hold Rand. Therava assures taht. Sevanna has the box that the *strange wetlander* gaver her but she decides not to use it?! WHAT?! And the tracing of Rand's neck was for a collar that she will put on Rand when she is his wife, how? And then the Wise Ones murder Desaine with the One Power. Confused. </p>

    <h2>Ch 54, The Sending, Wolf Icon</h2>
    <p>Perrin. "Come now. Many two-legs. Many, many, many! Come now!". Okay, a LOT OF PEOPLE coming to save Rand. And the Salidar Embassy, and Two Rivers People, All that was talked about last chapter. OKAY READING CH 55 NOW!</p>

    <h2>Ch 55, Dumai's Wells, Aes Sedai Icon</h2>
    <p>Gawyn. At the front of this Aes Sedai party. One of Gawyn's men is killed by Aiel. Gawyn orders a halt and Galina is UPSET. They agree they should be cautious. </p>

    <p>Rand. Suffering in the chest. He could feel Alanna nearer. He thought he was halucinating. The box is put on the ground, but it doesn't open, Rand is afraid they will leave him in all night. He screams. They haven't tied the weave. </p>

    <p>Perrin. GEEZ THIS IS BRUTAL. WHOA! Okay, the Asha'man are here!!!!! Perrin calls the wolves, the Greens are coming in hot with FIRE! Kiruna says there are two or three hundred women channeling, I thought that was just 33 from their camp? oh but the Shaido channelers? Hmm, I'm hung up! Reading on!</p>

    <p>Rand. This was ABSOLUTELY INSANE!!! SO MUCH DESTRUCTION! YES YES YES YES SO SO GOOD! Freaking heck yes, The nine Salidar Aes Sedai swear fealty to Rand and "the unstained tower, broken, bent knee to the forgotten sign." YES YES YES YES YES. I have so much more to say. Wow. This was freaking crazy. Oh whoa, an epilogue! </p>

    <p>Rand and LTT with the shields, YES. Rand commanding Taim with the Asha'man YES! The Asha'man ripping Shaido apart YES! YES YES!</p>

    <h2>Epilogue, The Answer, Wheel and Snake Icon</h2>
    <p>Falion. In Ebou Dar on orders from Mogi.. was this the woman in the window on that saw Nynaeve?</p>

    <p>Herrid Fel. Idrien. Whoa! Gholam.. the seanchan are coming, the SEANCHAN are coming! </p>

    <p>SEANCHAN. So Mat’s taveren pull must’ve been there when that man just so happen to be at the same inn as Mat when Mat said “the daughter of the nine moons”! The seanchan are coming back!</p>

    <p>Mogi. I knew Aran’gar channeled saidin. And whoa, Mogi is released from the a’dam and she’s being summoned to Shayol Ghul. </p>

    <p>Egwene. Egwene knows that Mogi has been released, and they have let Logain go. Where is Logain going?! To the Black Tower?! The flash of pain meant a male channeler.</p> 

    <p>Demandred. The Great Lord laughs at Damandred because Damandred asked “have I not done well?”  Shaidar Haran is here. </p>
