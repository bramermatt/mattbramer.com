<h2 id="written">Written Review</h2>
    <p>An incredible story, characters, world, twists, magic, fantasy. The whole pie! A MUST READ!</p>

<p>I was absolutely blown away by this book! This story is huge and expansive, and I have so many questions! I look forward to see what happens next! A lot of people say this is a Lord of the Rings copy... at this point I hadn't read Lord of the Rings but Wheel of Time takes what the Lord of the Rings does and takes it's own spin on it. A beautifully written story with incredible characters, deep plot, and an exciting magic system!</p>


<p>This is a little insight into how I write my reviews, I mark down what page I’m on and my thoughts at that time.</p>

<p>The Eye of the World - Robert Jordan Review: Started reading 3.14.22</p>

    <summary>Notes As I Read</summary>

<p>40. Wow. I’m already really engaged. I’ve been excited to read this for a few months now. I’ve even skipped books I had already planned to read and here I am. Here we go! The Eye of the World.</p>

<p>157. Okay, I have never read a more exciting action scene or world building. This is absolutely incredible. These characters are deep and this story is so compelling. We are about to go on a grand adventure!!</p>

<p>244. I don’t even know what words to say at this point. This book is absolutely incredible. These characters are enthralling, this story is enthralling, this world is enthralling. My initial thoughts as I started reading were that, there is no way this story can be 14 books. But, I have no idea where this story is going, and that’s exciting! Who is (spoiler) and what can (spoiler)?! I can’t wait to read more.</p>

<p>312. Moving, right, along! Things are POPPING OFF!</p>

<p>458. I’m really enjoying what I’m reading so far!</p>

<p>501. Definitely going to continue reading today, but I just wanted to quote this great chapter ending line, “Rand began to think their problems were over till they reached Caemlyn. But then they came to Four Kings”. What an ending to chapter 31!</p>

<p>615. I am amazed by this book.</p>

<p>753. 61 pages to go. Will we find out who the Dragon Reborn is?!</p>

<p>814. An incredible story, characters, world, twists, magic, fantasy. The whole pie! A MUST READ!</p>
