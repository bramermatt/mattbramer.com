    <h2>Where I'm At (Aug 2023)</h2>
    <p>I am currently reading Towers of Midnight: (<a href="../docs/towers-of-midnight-book-review.html" target="_blank">review here</a>), and I am halfway through the book..whoa. I have read the previous 12 books over the last 2 years. However, I have strictly read Wheel of Time since April this year. </p>

    <h2>April 2023</h2>
    <p>At that point I was reading other books and series. I would read Wheel of Time, but I wasn't full steam ahead Wheel of Time! I really enjoyed the Wheel of Time and I was truly enjoying reading other books, but Wheel of Time took hold on me. Things that brought the interest back, the Amazon Prime Wheel of Time TV Show (<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Wheel-Time-Season-1/dp/B09F59CZ7R" target="_blank">link</a>), and The Wheel Weaves Podcast (<a href="https://www.thewheelweavespodcast.com/" target="_blank">link</a>) - they are absolutely incredible for first-time-readers like me!</p>

    <h2>When Will I Finish WOT</h2>
    <p>My plan to finish the Wheel of Time is to finish before our daughter, Hazel, is born. She is due in early October! Our son, Everett (3), is very very excited to meet her. </p>
    
    <p>This was a self-imposed timeline, but I think I'm going to be able to do it! I'm able to read at work, I work in IT, and that is super helpful! Otherwise, I wouldn't be able to finish these books in the time that I am finishing these books. </p>
    
    <p>I'm halfway through Towers of Midnight, on page 545 to be exact, and there are 946 pages in the whole book. I should be able to finish this book Friday, if all goes well. There are extenuating circumstances everywhere, but this is what I'm looking at!</p>
    
    <h2>After Towers of Midnight</h2>
    <p>Towers of Midnight is book thirteen, there are fifteen books in the series including the prequel which I haven't read yet. So, after Towers of Midnight, I'll read A Memory of Light book fourteen. That's 920+ pages! And the final book in the series.. oh I'm so excited about that. Now, after that, I'll read the prequel New Spring! That's a solo Robert Jordan novella. Brandon Sanderson completed the series after Robert Jordan's passing in 2007.</p>
    
    <p>And that'll be the final Wheel of TIme book that I'll read for the first time.. yes, that is so good. Typically, people like to start rereading The Wheel of Time after you've finished reading The Wheel of Time. I'm not going to do that.</p>
    
    <h2>Why I'm Not Rereading Right Now</h2>
    <p>I love the Wheel of Time, it is incredible. Oh, it is so so good. But, I'm also very excited to read some Brandon Sanderson, Stephen King, Rick Riordan, James S.A. Corey (the Expanse), and more on my bookshelf. I may very well do some more reading of the Wheel of Time in between reading other things, because I'm also going to try and buy all the hardcover editions of the books!</p>
    
    <h2>Plans After WOT</h2>
    <p>After all that, I think I'm going to jump into Tress of the Emerald Sea by Brandon Sanderson. Because I know a lot of people like Tress, and I love Brandon Sanderson - oh he is such a good writer, my favorite living fantasy author!</p>

    <p>After Tress, I have more books on my bookshelf to read, you can read my TBR for 2023 (<a href="../docs/2023-tbr.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">link</a>) and see what else is on my bookshelf! I am interested in The Expanse, I haven't read any of that yet, a sci-fi story! I would also like to reread The Stormlight Archive by Brandon Sanderson, but also there are more series I'd like to read... so who knows!</p>
    
    <p>I do believe that Tress will be my first after Wheel of Time book that I read. </p>
