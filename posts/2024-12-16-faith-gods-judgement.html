        <h2>Intro</h2>
<p>Today, we are going to be reading about the conquest of Ai. Ai was the kingdom we read about, two weeks ago now, in Joshua 7. The Israelites were defeated because their plan to take over was thwarted; their plan didn’t involve asking God for help or following his plan. </p>

<p>Something that we’ll begin to read, and maybe we’ve already caught on, these early books in the Old Testament about the Israelites in battles with other kingdoms can be somewhat disturbing. Disturbing in many ways, but you may question, is this God’s Judgement on people who don’t follow God or is this just cruel?</p>

<p>I also want us to wrestle with these texts. Sometimes they’re pretty straightforward, like we’ll see today, but as Christians we are to follow God. Following God and putting our faith and trust in him means that we will be jumping into a life that is full of faith. Sometimes it’s hard to defend what people consider this “Angry Old Testament God”. </p>

<p>But we know what happens to those that don’t follow Jesus and don’t follow God: when they die, they will live eternally separated from the great joy that is Jesus in Heaven. </p>

<p>As Christians, how do we reconcile this “Angry Old Testament God” with the loving Jesus we see in the New Testament? </p>

<h2>Background </h2>
<h3>Deuteronomy 7:1-6: God’s Judgment or Cruelty?</h3>
<p>Passage Overview (Deuteronomy 7:1-6): In this passage, God commands the Israelites to utterly destroy the Canaanite nations that occupy the Promised Land, citing the reason as the Canaanites’ corrupt practices, including idolatry, witchcraft, and immorality. Israel is to make no covenants with them and not intermarry with them. The Israelites are chosen by God to be a holy nation, separate from other nations.</p>

<h4>Key Insights on God’s Character:</h4>
<p>God’s Holiness and Justice: God's command to destroy the Canaanites reflects His intolerance for sin, as their practices (idolatry, child sacrifice) violated His laws, and His justice demands the punishment of unrepentant evil.</p>
<p>God’s Covenant Faithfulness: Israel’s selection as God’s special people is based on His love and promise to their ancestors, showing His faithfulness to the covenant and His desire for Israel to remain holy.</p>
<p>Separation for Purity: God commands Israel to avoid intermarriage and alliances with the Canaanites to preserve their spiritual purity and loyalty to Him alone.</p>

<h4>Inviting Questions for Understanding God’s Character:</h4>
<p>What does God's command to destroy the Canaanites teach us about His view of sin?</p>
<p>Why do you think God chose Israel to be His special people?</p>
<p>What is the significance of God calling His people to be set apart?</p> 
<p>Can we understand God's judgment as an act of mercy in the context of this passage?</p> 


<h3>Deuteronomy 28:25-26: Consequences of Disobedience</h3>
<p>Passage Overview (Deuteronomy 28:25-26): In this section of Deuteronomy, God warns the Israelites of the consequences they will face if they disobey His commands. Specifically, these verses describe how Israel will be defeated by their enemies, taken captive, and their bodies will be left as prey for birds and beasts. This is part of the broader "Curses for Disobedience" in Deuteronomy 28, showing the dire consequences of forsaking God’s commands.</p>

<h4>Key Insights on God’s Character:</h4>
<p>God’s Justice in Discipline: God warns of severe consequences for disobedience, reflecting His divine justice; sin has tangible consequences, and turning from God invites judgment as a reminder of His holiness.</p>
<p>God’s Desire for Obedience: The severity of God's warnings underscores His desire for Israel to choose life through obedience, with curses meant to call them back to righteousness out of love.</p>
<p>God’s Longing for Restoration: Even in judgment, God’s ultimate plan is to restore His people, offering hope for repentance and redemption, pointing to His greater plan through Christ.</p>
<p>God's Mercy Despite Judgment:The conditional nature of the curses shows that God's mercy remains available to those who repent; judgment is not final when people turn back to God.</p>

<h4>Inviting Questions for Understanding God’s Character:</h4>
<p>How do the consequences described here show the seriousness of disobedience in God’s eyes?</p> 

<p>What does the intensity of these curses teach us about God's holiness and justice?</p> 

<p>What role do consequences play in God’s relationship with His people? Is God cruel for allowing punishment?</p> 

<p>How does this passage point toward God’s longing for His people to return to Him, even when they face consequences?</p> 

<h2>Main</h2>
<h3>Joshua 8:1-29: The Conquest of Ai</h3>
<p>Yes, Joshua 8:1-29 is a pivotal passage where God provides clear instructions to the Israelites for the conquest of Ai. After their initial defeat (Joshua 7), this victory is a demonstration of God’s faithfulness, justice, and the necessity of obedience. 

<h4>Here's a deeper look at this passage and how it reflects God's nature:</h4>
<p>Overview of the Passage: After Israel’s failure to conquer Ai due to Achan’s sin (Joshua 7), God instructs Joshua to lead the Israelites in a renewed attack on Ai. This time, God’s strategy is different:</p>

<h3>Joshua 8:1-2 – God’s Reassurance and Instructions:</h3>
<p>God tells Joshua not to fear and assures him of victory. He gives specific instructions to set an ambush behind the city, emphasizing His faithfulness despite Israel’s earlier failure.</p>

<p>Question: How does God’s reassurance to Joshua show His commitment to His promises, even after Israel’s failure?</p>

<p>How does God’s reassurance reveal His mercy despite Israel's previous disobedience?</p>

<p>What can we learn about God’s nature when He gives clear instructions after Israel’s failure at Ai?</p>

<p>How does God’s command “Do not be afraid or discouraged” apply to our personal challenges today?</p>

<p>Why do you think God still involved Israel in the battle instead of giving them victory without a fight?</p>


<h3>Joshua 8:3-13 – The Battle Plan:</h3>
<p>Joshua carries out God’s plan, setting an ambush with a small group to lure the men of Ai, while the larger Israelite army waits to attack. This strategy highlights the importance of trusting and obeying God’s guidance, rather than relying on human wisdom.</p>

<p>Question: Why do you think God chose such an unconventional strategy for victory, rather than a direct military attack?</p>

<p>What does Joshua's obedience to God’s unconventional strategy teach about trusting God’s wisdom over our own?</p>

<p>How does the battle plan show God’s ability to use both spiritual and practical strategies for victory?</p>

<p>In what ways can trusting God’s guidance in our lives feel like setting an “ambush” against unseen challenges?</p>

<p>What does Joshua’s leadership here reveal about following God’s instructions with faith and precision?</p>


<h3>Joshua 8:14-29 – The Victory and Destruction of Ai:</h3>
<p>The Israelites successfully execute the plan, ambushing and defeating the men of Ai. The city is completely destroyed, and the king of Ai is hanged, symbolizing God’s justice against sin and disobedience.</p>

<p>Question: What does the complete destruction of Ai teach us about the seriousness of sin and disobedience to God?</p>

<p>How does the destruction of Ai illustrate God’s justice and holiness?
What can we learn about God’s patience and judgment in how He dealt with Ai compared to Jericho?</p>

<p>How should understanding God’s justice shape the way we live today?</p>

<p>How does the victory at Ai reflect God’s power to restore His people after failure when they repent?</p>

<p>How can we reconcile God’s mercy with His judgment seen in the destruction of Ai?</p>

<h4>Key Insights on God’s Character in Joshua 8:1-29:</h4>
<p>God’s Faithfulness: Despite Israel’s failure due to Achan’s sin, God reassures Joshua and the people of Israel, promising victory. His faithfulness remains, even in the face of failure.</p>

<p>Application: God’s faithfulness is not dependent on our perfection. Even when we fail, God is ready to help us get back on track if we repent and obey.</p>

<p>Question: How can we apply God’s faithfulness in our own failures? What does it mean to trust in His promises despite our shortcomings?</p>

<p>God’s Justice: The destruction of Ai represents God’s judgment on a wicked city that defied His commands. Ai’s destruction is a direct consequence of its sin.</p>

<p>Application: God is just. He requires that sin be dealt with, either through judgment or through the sacrifice of Christ.</p>

<p>Question: What does the destruction of Ai reveal about the relationship between God’s justice and His mercy?</p>

<p>Obedience to God’s Word: Israel’s victory is directly tied to their obedience to God’s specific instructions. Success comes when they trust and follow His guidance.
Application: Spiritual victory depends on obedience to God’s Word. Though His plans may not always make sense, they are always for our good.</p>

<p>Question: What are some areas of our lives where we might be tempted to trust our own wisdom instead of God’s plan? How can we cultivate greater obedience to His Word?</p>

<p>God’s Strategy for Victory: The ambush strategy shows that God’s ways are often unconventional. The success at Ai was not due to military strength but divine guidance.</p>

<p>Application: We may not always understand God’s plan or timing, but His ways are higher than ours. Trusting His guidance is crucial for victory in our lives.
Question: Can you think of a time when God led you in a way that didn’t make sense at first, but you later saw His wisdom? How did trusting in His guidance lead to success or growth?</p>

<h3>Joshua 8:30-35: The Words of the Law</h3>
<p>In Joshua 8:30-35, after the victory at Ai, Joshua obeys God's command to publicly renew the covenant by reading the words of the Law. This passage is significant as it emphasizes the importance of remembering and following God's Word, not just in times of victory, but as an ongoing commitment to the covenant. </p>

<h4>Joshua 8:30-31 – The Altar on Mount Ebal:</h4>
<p>Joshua builds an altar to the Lord on Mount Ebal, following God’s command from Deuteronomy 27:4-8. The altar is constructed with uncut stones and used for burnt and peace offerings, symbolizing a return to God through worship.</p>

<p>Question: Why do you think God specifically commanded the altar to be built with uncut stones? What might this symbolize about the people’s relationship with Him?</p>

<h4>Joshua 8:32 – The Law Read Aloud:</h4>
<p>Joshua reads the Law of Moses aloud to all the people, ensuring that everyone, including men, women, children, and foreigners, hears the covenant’s requirements. This public reading reaffirms the covenant and reminds the people of the blessings for obedience and the curses for disobedience.</p>

<p>Question: What does the public reading of the Law reveal about God’s desire for His people to be aligned with His Word?</p>


<h4>Joshua 8:33-35 – The Covenant Renewed:</h4>
<p>Joshua makes sure the entire nation, including leaders and all the people, are present to hear every part of the Law. This renewal of the covenant emphasizes the importance of the entire community living according to God’s will.</p>

<p>Question: What does the communal aspect of this covenant renewal teach us about the collective responsibility of God’s people?</p>


<h4>Key Insights on God’s Character in Joshua 8:30-35:</h4>
<p>God’s Desire for Obedience and Worship: The building of the altar and the reading of the Law reflect God’s desire for His people to remain faithful through worship and obedience. God commands a communal reaffirmation of the covenant, showing that worship and faithfulness are not just private acts but collective responsibilities.</p>

<p>Application: God desires our hearts to be turned toward Him not only individually but as a community of believers. How can we encourage and support each other in living lives of worship and obedience?</p>


<p>God’s Word as the Foundation for Life: The Law is presented as more than just rules; it is the foundation for the Israelites' identity and way of life in the Promised Land. By reading the Law aloud, Joshua emphasizes its importance for guiding their decisions and shaping their actions.</p>

<p>Application: God’s Word must be central in our lives, guiding us in our decisions and actions. How can we make God’s Word more central in our daily lives, both individually and within the church community?</p>


<p>God’s Covenant Faithfulness: The renewal of the covenant serves as a reminder of God’s faithfulness, even in the face of Israel’s previous failures. Despite their challenges, God has brought them into the land, and they are called to live according to His will.</p>

<p>Application: God is faithful to His promises, and He calls us to respond with faithfulness in return. How can we remember and celebrate God’s faithfulness in our lives and renew our commitment to follow Him?</p>


<p>The Importance of Public Commitment: The Israelites publicly renew their commitment to God, with Joshua ensuring that everyone hears and understands the covenant. This public acknowledgment reinforces the communal aspect of their relationship with God.</p>

<p>Application: Public worship and covenant renewal keep us accountable and remind us of our shared commitment to God. How does your community of faith help you stay accountable in your commitment to God?</p>
