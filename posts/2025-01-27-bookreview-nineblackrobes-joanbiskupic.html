        <p>I'm going to start this review with a short biography of Joan Biskupic; she is a journalist and legal analyst with extensive experience covering the U.S. Supreme Court. She has reported on the Court for over two decades, providing in-depth coverage of the justices and their decisions. Biskupic has written for major publications like USA Today and Reuters, and her work has focused on the intersection of law, politics, and the inner workings of the Court. Her previous books include biographies of Supreme Court justices, and Nine Black Robes continues her exploration of the Court’s influence on American society.</p>

        <p>Nine Black Robes is a tremendous biographical investigation of the Supreme Court and the Justices as they judge and determine outcomes of some major cases over the last four years. Biskupic has a very distinct political lean, and it shows throughout the book. I thought that would turn me away from this book, as I read, but honestly, Biskupic's writing is so inviting and well researched. This book is a very human examination on these Justices, and that's what this book is about. Biskupic looks at each Justice, no matter their typical decision, with deep background information on each of the nine Justices, and it is an incredibly interesting read. </p>
            
        <p>Biskupic focuses on several landmark cases that have defined the Roberts Court. The Roberts Court is known as that because of the Chief Justice, John Roberts, who was appointed in 2005 by President George W. Bush. Roberts, a moderate conservative, has earned a reputation for balancing ideological views in his rulings. The Court also includes Clarence Thomas, appointed by George H.W. Bush in 1991, who is known for his originalist views and has served as the longest-tenured justice. Antonin Scalia, a deeply influential conservative appointed by Ronald Reagan in 1986, shaped the Court's ideological direction until his death in 2016. </p>
            
        <p>Ruth Bader Ginsburg, appointed by Bill Clinton in 1993, became a liberal icon for her work on gender equality and civil liberties until her passing in 2020. Stephen Breyer, also appointed by Clinton in 1994, was known for his pragmatic approach and progressive views before retiring in 2022. Samuel Alito, a conservative appointed by George W. Bush in 2006, is noted for his defense of religious freedoms. Sonia Sotomayor, appointed by Barack Obama in 2009, is the first Latina justice and is known for her advocacy of social justice. Elena Kagan, also appointed by Obama in 2010, is known for her consensus-building approach and sharp legal acumen. Lastly, Neil Gorsuch, appointed by Donald Trump in 2017, is a staunch originalist with a focus on textualism in interpreting the Constitution.</p>
            
        <p>I absolutely loved this, and I'm so excited to read more about the Supreme Court, and I even want to start paying attention to my local court, however, I digress. </p>
            
        <p>Biskupic's examination of these cases focus on the ideological shifts and tensions among the justices. One of the most prominent cases in the book is Bush v. Gore (2000), which decided the outcome of the contentious 2000 presidential election. This case marked a defining moment for the Court and set the tone for the decisions to follow.</p>
            
        <p>Another key case explored in the book is Citizens United v. FEC (2010), a decision that drastically changed the landscape of political funding by ruling that corporations and unions could spend unlimited amounts on independent political advertisements. This case is particularly significant in understanding the Court's impact on campaign finance and the broader political system.</p>
            
        <p>Biskupic also delves into National Federation of Independent Business v. Sebelius (2012), a case that upheld the Affordable Care Act’s individual mandate, preserving a key piece of President Obama’s healthcare reform. The author examines how the justices wrestled with issues of federal power and individual rights, showcasing the Court's complex role in shaping the nation's policy direction.</p>
            
        <p>The book also explores Obergefell v. Hodges (2015), the landmark decision that legalized same-sex marriage nationwide, and Shelby County v. Holder (2013), which struck down a key provision of the Voting Rights Act. These cases highlight the Court’s evolving role in defining civil rights in America, an issue that remains at the forefront of legal and political debate.</p>
            
        <p>Through these cases, Biskupic reveals not only the legal and political dimensions of the Court's decisions but also the personalities and dynamics that shape the justices' rulings. Her examination is both thorough and accessible, offering readers a deeper understanding of how the Supreme Court operates and its influence on American society.</p>
