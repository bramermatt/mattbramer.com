                <h2>Written Review</h2>
                <p>This was an awesome book, a lot of fun, and a really great Star Wars Story! This is only my second Star Wars book that I've read and it was a great time! It was a bit of a shorter book - 329 pages in the Hardback, but it was a good time, for sure. This was a story of.. "Cato Nemoidia", and it was a good succinct story, and I liked that. It wasn't too big or too long, and it was a delightful read for anyone who loves Star Wars!</p>
            
                <p>Also, some very LAUGH OUT LOUD SCENES, like this about Sand... "See," he said to no one in particular, "no one ever believes me but it gets <em>everywhere</em>." I couldn't stop laughing about this.</p>

                <h2>Obi-Wan</h2>
                    <p>I love Obi-Wan, and I always have - and I felt Mike Chen did an incredible job here with the way Obi-Wan both spoke and acted.</p>
            
                <h2>Anakin</h2>
                    <p>I also love Anakin, and his character here is a good encapsulation of Anakin's character. I love the scenes with Anakin and Mill, because it is Anakin being this character that hasn't had a Youngling or Padawan before and I think it was just great.</p>
            
                <h2>Mill</h2>
                    <p>Mill was a lot of fun! Her take on everything was a good read. She is a good character to have as someone who is questioning everything, but not annoying. I really liked her character.</p>
            
                <h2>This Story of Cato Nemoidia</h2>
                    <p>This was a good story, I thought. Interesting story of politics and Star Wars, always a good bet!</p>

                <h2>Score</h2>
                <p>I'm trying a new way of reviewing, by implementing a new way to review - using a format taken from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@2ToRamble" target="_blank">2toRamble</a>! <em>And that’s the system! Rate those 5 categories out of 10, average your score, and that’s your /10 Rambler Rating! You can rate each category to the nearest hundredth, tenth, whole number, or whatever you please.</em></p>
                    
                <p>This scored a total of 3.8 out of 5, which rounds up to 4/5! I really appreciated the story and I enjoyed my time with the book. It didn't absolutely blow me away, but I enjoyed it.</p>
