                <p>Started reading May 2, 2024. Finished reading May 3, 2024.</p>
                <p>Another great 9Marks: Building Healthy Churches book! Matt Merker, I didn't realize that I'd heard Matt lead worship at the Together For the Gospel Conference in 2022! How neat to get to read this book! I learned so much, and I look forward to applying some of these thoughts into my own worship structure. </p>

                <h2>Back Cover</h2>
                <p><strong>WHAT IS THE ROLE OF CORPORATE WORSHIP IN THE CHURCH?</strong></p>
                <p>Christians worship God at church every week, but many don't know exactly what worship is or why they do it. For some, it's a warm-up for the sermon. For others, it's a "me-and-Jesus" moment. What is the biblically informed way to view corporate worship?</p>
                
                <p>In this book, Matt Merker shows that corporate worship is the gathering of God's people by his grace, for his glory, for their good, and before a watching world. He offers biblical insights and practical suggestions for making worship what is truly is meant to be: a foretaste of God's people worshiping together for eternity in the new creation.</p>
                
                
                <h2>Memorable Quotes</h2>
                <blockquote>"The point isn't so much the intensity of the emotional experience we have from week to week - we can leave that up to God. The point is that as we sing, we grow in knowing, trusting, and adoring the triune God who is worthy of our praise. Through our singing, we help others delight in him as well. " (p. 139)</blockquote>
                
                <blockquote>"If your church meets in a context where you can sing as loud as possible without fear of arrest, why would you not take full advantage of that freedom?" (p. 150)</blockquote>
                
                <blockquote>"Together as a church, we raise our voices in unison, knowing that one day the storms of darkness will end. Our singing anticipates something else - another time and another place. Our singing is not yet what it one day will be. It offers a foretaste of the day when all of God's family will gather around the throne. One that day, we will gather alongside our brave brothers and sisters in the new heaven and new earth, where no power or principality will oppose them because King Jesus has won." (p. 150)</blockquote>
                
                <blockquote>"I'll bet they will sing their lungs out. The trumpet will sound, a new song will begin, and God's people from every tribe and tongue will lift up an anthem of praise that will echo on and on and on - into eternity" (p. 150)</blockquote>
