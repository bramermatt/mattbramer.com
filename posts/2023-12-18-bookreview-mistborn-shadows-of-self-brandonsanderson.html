    <h2>Written Review</h2>
    <p>Sadly, this entry in the Mistborn saga left a little bit to be desired. I really felt like this story had no real impact on the story, truly, until the final 3 pages. Luckily this story was only 435 pages long, I really felt this story wasn't as fun as Allow of Law or that important to the entire narrative as a whole. We didn't get much character development and I didn't laugh as much as I did with Allow of Law, which is what I'm really comparing this too as we are in Era 2 now. </p>
    
    
    <p>We did get some reveals of some more backstory between our characters, which was neat! I just feel like I want more about Allomancy and Feruchemy. I'm worried, but still hopeful about the continuation of this series - that we've already seen it all. There are hints of more to come from the cosmere here, but we're still pretty well confined to Elendel. I love the ties to the original trilogy here, and there is more of that. Do I feel some things are put into this story to connect to that, no, were there plot points in this story that felt rushed, yes. </p>
        
    <p>This story felt very small compared to what I would expect from Brandon Sanderson. I'm a little disappointed here. </p>
        
    <p>Overall this was a fine story. We didn't get much more information on the magic systems, we got hints of more, and we were left with a mystery. Ah, I'm a little down on this story - I'm hopeful for the next entry! </p>
