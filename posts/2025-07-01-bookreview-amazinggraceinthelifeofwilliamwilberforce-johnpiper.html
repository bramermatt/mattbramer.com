                <p> Wow—what a life. Piper writes beautifully (this is the first book I’ve read by him!), and this little book really opened my eyes to a man who was both deeply joyful and deeply committed to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jesus" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Christ</a>. The “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazing_Grace" target="_blank" rel="noopener">amazing grace</a>” in the title isn’t just about saving grace—it’s about sustaining grace. Grace that fueled <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Wilberforce" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Wilberforce</a> through sickness, setbacks, and decades of work to end the slave trade.</p>

<p>One thing that stood out was how happy he was. Not fake-happy. Real, deep, Christ-centered joy. Piper describes him as “always happy,” and it’s true. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Wilberforce" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Wilberforce</a> embodied what <a href="https://www.desiringgod.org/topics/christian-hedonism" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Piper calls Christian Hedonism</a>—the idea that delighting in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/God_in_Christianity" target="_blank" rel="noopener">God</a> is the heart of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christianity" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Christian</a> life. That joy gave him strength, perspective, and perseverance.</p>

<p>Piper also draws from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Wilberforce" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Wilberforce’s</a> own book, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Practical_View_of_Christianity" target="_blank" rel="noopener">A Practical View of Christianity</a>. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Wilberforce" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Wilberforce</a> didn’t want a cold, lifeless faith. He pushed back hard against the cultural <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christianity" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Christianity</a> of his day—people who said the right things but weren’t changed by grace. For him, true faith wasn’t just belief—it was joy in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jesus" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Christ</a> that spilled over into action, especially in fighting injustice.</p>

<p>This book encouraged me more than I expected. I came into it knowing almost nothing about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Wilberforce" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Wilberforce</a>, and I left feeling like I had met a man who truly walked with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jesus" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jesus</a>. It stirred up in me a desire to live more joyfully—not just to have joy, but to live from it. It made me want to stay faithful in the daily grind, to keep going when things are hard, and to let the grace of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/God_in_Christianity" target="_blank" rel="noopener">God</a> shape everything I do. (And Piper does all this in only 80 pages!)</p>

<p>And just to be clear—despite the title, this book isn’t about the hymn <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazing_Grace" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Amazing Grace</a>. It’s about the actual grace of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/God_in_Christianity" target="_blank" rel="noopener">God</a> that saved <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Wilberforce" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Wilberforce</a> and carried him through his whole life. That grace gave him perseverance in politics, gentleness in suffering, and a contagious gladness that came straight from knowing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jesus" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Christ</a>. Piper captures that beautifully.</p>
