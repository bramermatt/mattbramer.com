<h2>Written Review</h2>
<p>Well, another FUN Harry Potter book! This story was a fun, quick, interesting mystery! We learn some new things here and I'm excited to see what happens next in the series. This book felt like a small entry into the series. </p>

<p>This was a good and fun book! I love this magic system and I love how these characters interact, I just wanted more out of this book and this story really.</p>

<p>It resolved quickly, the stakes seem very low, and things just kind of always happen for the best for our characters.</p>

<p>We also had some introductions to some characters that might actually only occur in this book, I haven't read ahead, but it was seemingly like they were here just for this entry in the series. We'll have to see what happens next. </p>

<p>Like I said, I really like this magic system and we got some new spells and new items added to the story and I'm interested to see where we go from here.</p>

<p>Time-Travel was something played with here, and that concerns me because how can that really be controlled? It could get very muddled if we start playing around with time, but I'll just have to see if this has much more impact on the story. </p>

<p>Snape will be Snape, Ron will be Ron, Hermione will be Hermione, Harry will be Harry, Hagrid will be Hagrid, come to think of it - every single character in these books, for every single book so far, has been fairly one-note. I hope there are some more character development in the next books.</p>

<p>Also, we get some more classes - I just want more out of this. How is Fantastic Beasts? More character perspectives?</p>

    <summary>Spoiler Story Breakdown</summary>
    
    <p>Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban is the third book in the series. Harry for the first time confronts the darker side of his own past and the pasts of some of the people he loves and trusts.</p>

    <p>Harry finds out his god-father, also a great friend to his father, is Sirius Black. Sirius Black, have we heard about him before? Not sure. We learn about the Azkaban Prison, and Dementors, some more magic. </p>
        
    <p>I do like this book!</p>
