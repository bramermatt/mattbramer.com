                <!-- Post goes here -->
                <h2>Intro</h2>
                <p>
                    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E._K._Johnston" target="_blank" rel="noopener">E.K. Johnston</a>'s "<a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29749107-ahsoka" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ahsoka</a>" occupies that peculiar middle ground where a book isn't quite good enough to recommend enthusiastically, yet isn't poor enough to dismiss outright. It's the literary equivalent of a shrug—competent, serviceable, but ultimately forgettable.
                </p>

                <h2>The Good</h2>
                <p>
                    The book's strongest moments come early. The prologue featuring <a href="https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Ahsoka_Tano" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ahsoka</a>'s confrontation with <a href="https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Darth_Maul" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Maul</a> crackles with tension and showcases Johnston's ability to capture the weight of these characters' shared history. Similarly, Ahsoka's internal monologue in the opening chapters provides genuine insight into her mindset following her departure from the <a href="https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Jedi_Order" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jedi Order</a>. These glimpses into her psychological state—the doubt, the determination, the careful balance between her past and uncertain future—represent the novel at its most compelling.
                </p>

                <p>
                    One aspect that deserves particular praise is the <a href="https://www.audible.com/pd/Ahsoka-Star-Wars-Audiobook/B01KGL1N6E" target="_blank" rel="noopener">audiobook</a> production. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ashley_Eckstein" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ashley Eckstein</a>, who voices Ahsoka in the animated series, brings an authenticity to the narration that elevates the entire experience. The added sound effects and musical cues create an immersive atmosphere that makes even the slower sections more engaging. If you're going to experience this story, the audiobook is definitely the way to go.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The timeline placement is another strength worth noting. Set in the immediate aftermath of <a href="https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Order_66" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Order 66</a>, the story captures Ahsoka during one of the most pivotal and traumatic periods in <a href="https://starwars.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Star Wars</a> history. There's something refreshing about seeing this galaxy-shattering event through the eyes of someone who was already on the outside looking in. The rawness of a galaxy where the Jedi have just been wiped out and the <a href="https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Galactic_Empire" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Empire</a> is consolidating power provides a compelling backdrop that gives weight to even mundane moments.
                </p>

                <p>
                    For readers deeply invested in <a href="https://starwars.com/series/star-wars-the-clone-wars" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Clone Wars</a> animated series, these character beats likely resonate even more strongly. Johnston clearly understands Ahsoka as a character, and when she focuses on the former <a href="https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Padawan" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Padawan</a>'s internal journey, the writing finds its footing.
                </p>

                <h2>The Frustrating</h2>
                <p>
                    Unfortunately, those strong character moments are buried beneath layers of mundane world-building and plotting that feels more obligatory than organic. Extended sequences devoted to board games that supposedly serve the larger plot left me checking the page count. The agricultural equipment descriptions and other minutiae that other reviewers have noted bog down what should be a tighter narrative about a character finding her place in a galaxy in turmoil.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The secondary characters—entirely new to someone like me who's only dabbled in <a href="https://starwars.com/series/star-wars-the-clone-wars" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Clone Wars</a>—fail to capture interest or feel essential to Ahsoka's story. They exist more as plot devices than fully realized people, making their extensive screen time feel unearned.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Perhaps most jarring is a brief cameo appearance by <a href="https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Leia_Organa" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Princess Leia</a> that feels completely disconnected from the story's flow. While only lasting a few paragraphs, it serves as an unwelcome reminder that you're reading a <a href="https://starwars.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Star Wars</a> product rather than experiencing Ahsoka's journey. These kinds of forced connections to the larger universe feel more like corporate mandate than organic storytelling.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The unnamed world where much of the action takes place similarly lacks the lived-in quality that makes the best <a href="https://starwars.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Star Wars</a> locations memorable. It's functional but forgettable, providing a backdrop rather than becoming a character in its own right.
                </p>

                <h2>The Verdict</h2>
                <p>
                    "<a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29749107-ahsoka" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ahsoka</a>" feels like a book written primarily for completionists—those who need to know what happened to <a href="https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Ahsoka_Tano" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ahsoka</a> between her <a href="https://starwars.com/series/star-wars-the-clone-wars" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Clone Wars</a> exit and her <a href="https://starwars.com/series/star-wars-rebels" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Rebels</a> appearance. For that specific audience, it likely succeeds in filling narrative gaps and providing closure.
                </p>

                <p>
                    For everyone else, it's a perfectly adequate <a href="https://starwars.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Star Wars</a> novel that never quite justifies its existence beyond franchise maintenance. Johnston has the writing chops to deliver something special, as evidenced by those early chapters, but the book too often gets trapped in its own perceived obligations to be more than just Ahsoka's story.
                </p>

                <p>
                    It's not a bad book. It's just not a particularly necessary one.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Recommended for: Die-hard <a href="https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Ahsoka_Tano" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ahsoka</a> fans, <a href="https://starwars.com/series/star-wars-the-clone-wars" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Clone Wars</a> completionists, but Skip if: You're looking for your next great <a href="https://starwars.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Star Wars</a> read or hoping for an accessible entry point to the character.
