                <h2>Written Review</h2>
                <p>This started off with a bang! But not in the way you'd think. Herbert, in DUNE, does a conversation scene very well! There are very few authors I've read that can gather in their characters in a room and I know who everyone is and they have separate voices, and the conversation is intriguing! Brandon Sanderson, Robert Jordan, George R.R. Martin, J.R.R. Tolkien, just to name a few other authors that do conversation scenes well. I truly love to read a group of characters just sitting and talking. And, this book... there is a lot of that! DUNE was an absolute epic, and now DUNE Messiah sees the aftermath of DUNE... starting 12 years after.</p> 

                <p>It starts off with a great re-introduction of the world, and that is very helpful for those who haven't read the series in a while... but also, I just finished re-reading DUNE, and the re-introduction is still helpful for me! I appreciate the re-introduction because it shows what is most important directly from the author. The re-introduction wouldn't be there if these topics weren't going to affect the story. </p>
                    
                <p>Oh wow do I love a book two of a series that dives WAY DEEP into the ramifications of the first book. DUNE MESSIAH brings that enjoyment to another level. This is great! I’m really loving this story. Just great stuff!</p>
                    
                <p>I'm so excited to read the rest of this series, because it is very relevant right now (being in the movies), but also this is just an awesome series! A great mix of fantasy and sci-fi. Two things I love. Also, this is a very interesting and intriguing plot with religion and philosophy. I do believe I will be reading the rest of the Frank Herbert books in the series. Being: Children of Dune (3), God Emperor - I AM SO EXCITED TO READ THIS (4), Heretics of Dune (5), and Chapterhouse: Dune (6). That's my goal.</p>
                    
                <p>On my bookshelf right now, I only have a few more fantasy / sci-fi books that I haven't read. I also have a lot of theology books. I'm very interested to see what happens after I finish reading what I've got to read..</p>
                    
                <p>"Dune Messiah" continues the epic tale of the Dune universe, picking up the story years after the climactic events of the first book. The novel delves into the complexities and consequences of the protagonist's ascension to power. Set in the distant future, the narrative is a rich tapestry of political intrigue, philosophical musings, and deep character studies, all woven into the vast and intricate universe Frank Herbert created.</p>
                    
                <p>One of the central themes of "Dune Messiah" is the exploration of the burdens and ethical dilemmas that come with great power. The story delves into how power can both elevate and corrupt, and the heavy responsibilities it places on those who wield it. The novel examines the profound impact of religion on society and its potential to be used as a tool for political control. It raises questions about faith, manipulation, and the true nature of spiritual leadership. The character arcs in "Dune Messiah" are both profound and complex. Herbert delves deeply into the psyche of his characters, revealing their internal struggles and growth. The protagonist, in particular, faces immense challenges that test his morality, resolve, and sense of self.</p>
                    
                <p>Frank Herbert’s world-building continues to impress in this sequel. The detailed descriptions of the planet Arrakis, the intricate political and religious systems, and the diverse cultures and factions add rich layers to the story. Herbert’s ability to create a believable and immersive universe is one of the standout features of the book. "Dune Messiah" is not just a continuation of an epic sci-fi saga; it’s also a philosophical exploration of profound themes. Herbert raises thought-provoking questions about the nature of power, the influence of religion, the possibility of changing one’s destiny, and the essence of identity and humanity.</p>
                    
                <p>One of the aspects I found particularly engaging was the intricate political and religious maneuvering. Herbert’s portrayal of the various factions and their schemes is masterful. Additionally, the detailed descriptions of the Dune universe, from the harsh desert landscapes to the opulent settings of power, create a vivid and immersive backdrop for the story.</p>
                    
                <p>Overall, "Dune Messiah" is a richly layered and thought-provoking novel that builds upon the foundation laid by "Dune." It’s a book that challenges the reader to think deeply about the nature of power, destiny, and identity. While it may be different in tone and pace from the first book, it is a worthy and essential continuation of the series. "Dune Messiah" holds an important place within the Dune series. It takes the epic saga in new and intriguing directions, delving into deeper philosophical and ethical questions. Frank Herbert’s masterful storytelling and world-building continue to shine, making it a significant and memorable installment in the series.</p>
