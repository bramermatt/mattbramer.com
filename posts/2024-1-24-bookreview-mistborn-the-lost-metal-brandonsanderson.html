<h2>Written Review</h2>
<p>Let's just say, as I start this last read of the latest release in the Mistborn saga, I want this to be good. I want to be happy as I leave Mistborn. I've heard such good things about Mistborn and I have been disappointed throughout my read really. It's been good, but not great or incredible. And that is what I've expected from Brandon Sanderson, incredible. </p>

<p>So far, this series has been something that I've really just wanted to finish so that I could read other series. At this point (January 4, 2024), I have been reading Mistborn from Mistborn: The Well of Ascension - November 28, 2024 up to now. So that is Mistborn 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 3.5, and now I'm onto 7. Here's hoping!</p>

<p>And, I've finished and I can certainly say this was the best book in the... oh wow... the series?! Ah, I'll put Mistborn: The Final Empire up there with Alloy of Law as 1 and 2, with this a close 3. Wow, this book was so much fun to read! We are INTO THE COSMERE Y'ALL! So much Cosmere connections. Do you have to read everything in Brandon Sanderson's cosmere? No, but you'll want to after this. The bits in here that were cosmere connections, you will be fine reading them, but won't it be fun to have the rest of the cosmere universe understood?! There is always another secret... that is right! </p>

<p>The characters here outshine everything. Wow, this was such a good ending to the Era Two.. ah, this was excellent. I'm happy to have made this journey. I struggled, as I said, with the rest of the series, but this was AMAZING! </p>

<p>The cosmere is huge and I can't wait to see what happens next. I am incredible proud of Brandon Sanderson for his work here, you can see how it's matured over the years of his writing style and composition, and this is just great stuff here. I am impressed. </p>

<p>Ah, what a good story here. </p>

<p>Where we are in the cosmere timeline is one thing, but the fact that gods can intervene on our stories is one thing. Knowing the intricacies of the world is another thing. This story takes that to a whole new level. It's incredible. It's awesome. It's epic. This is really what I wanted out of the series as a whole, I'm happy to have gotten it here at least, but wow - the whole series like this, on this scale is what I wanted. </p>

<p>I loved the interwoven storylines, the way each chapter - and sometimes in the same chapter - would weave together, it was fast paced and made for a great fun, and fast read. I can really appreciate the pacing of a story when the point of views seen are those of the same scene or different scenes happening at the same time - but another location. Epic scale. Ah, I really enjoyed this. </p>

<h2>Spoilers</h2>
<p>I really enjoyed this book, be prepared there will be spoilers.</p>

    <summary>Notes as I Read</summary>
    <h2>Thoughts on Part One</h2>
<p>And now, I am feeling a sense of satisfaction and renewed vigor towards this story. I look forward to seeing what happens. This is really what I've been looking for. Super cosmere-aware story here, and even a mention of Trell - Autonomy - Bavadin (another SHARD!). The avatar of Autonomy is actually Telsin. Wax has geared up and goes off to stop a bomb in Bilming. </p>

<h2>Thoughts on Part Two</h2>
<p>Wow, Marsh/Death is incredible. What a touchstone to Era One. This has been the best book... second best in Era Two. This story has been fast and exciting and interesting. I can't wait to read what happens next. I have no idea what could happen. I'm really trying to figure out everyone's intentions before they show and I think that is the idea with a good story. Intrigue. Let's see what Part Three has in store. </p>

<h2>Thoughts on Part Three</h2>
<p>This is exactly what I needed. A timecrunch with a legit intriguing story about the world of the cosmere with Kelsier back and world-hoppers and GHOSTBLOODS! I am HERE! Feeling very, very, good about this book... maybe back to a 5/5?!?!</p>

<p>Wow, that was incredible. A fiting conclusion to this book... and wow a certain 5 OUT OF 5 from me. This was exceptional, especially from the rest of this Era of books. Wax and Wayne. Marasi, Steris, ahh. This was just exceptional - that's the word. I loved this, really felt good to read. Now, onto the Epilogue(S)?! MULTIPLE EPILOGUES?!</p>

<h2>Epilogues</h2>
<p>Absolutely awesome to see the aftermath of this series on it's characters. Superbly well written and well crafted. This is why I love Brandon Sanderson. Excellent.</p>
