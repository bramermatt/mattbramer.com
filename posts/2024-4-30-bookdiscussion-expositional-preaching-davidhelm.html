                <h2>Started Reading</h2>
                <p>Started reading April 29, 2024. Finished reading April 30, 2024.</p>

                <h2>Written Review</h2>
                <p>I am certainly so very happy to be reading these quick little 9Marks: Building Healthy Churches books. These are great! This is my second book that I've read and I am loving it! There are countless topics and ideas in this book that were SO HELPFUL for me as a Christian who has been preaching a few times. I am certainly going to continue reading more of this series. They're great and they're short! Around 100 pages, good for those who aren't very interested in reading for fun. </p>

                <p>There are so many more things I want to learn more about: Systematic Theology, Exegesis, and just plain Biblical Theology. I love this stuff. I love Jesus and really the most important piece is the Exegesis - giving the Word as exactly the Word says. Ah, I'm just so happy to be here and talking about Jesus. </p>

                <p>I am preaching on John 19:28-42 on May 12 and this has been a vital resource for me to learn and understand a better framing for the Word. I have so many things in my repertoire now that are going to help me preaching the Word. Oh wow, I loved this book! </p>

                <p>Helm, the author, elegantly develops processes of reading and understanding the word in many different ways. Let me just say, I am so inspired by people who can concisely explain the Gospel and the story of the Bible and the way the ENTIRE BIBLE POINTS TO JESUS.</p>

<h2>What is the Book About</h2>
<p>Expositional preaching, as advocated by David Helm and promoted by 9Marks ministry, is a method of preaching that prioritizes the faithful explanation and application of a biblical text. Here's an overview:</p>

<p><strong>Biblical Basis:</strong>  Expositional preaching finds its foundation in the belief that the Bible is God's inspired and authoritative Word. Therefore, the preacher's task is to faithfully proclaim what the text says, rather than imposing personal opinions or agendas.</p>

<p><strong>Text-Driven:</strong> The focus of expositional preaching is on the text itself. Preachers carefully examine the historical and literary context of a passage to understand its original meaning. This includes considering the author's intent, the audience, cultural background, and literary genre.</p>

<p><strong>Verse-by-Verse or Passage-by-Passage:</strong> Expositional sermons typically work through a book of the Bible systematically, covering each verse or passage in sequence. This approach allows for a comprehensive exploration of the biblical text and ensures that the congregation receives a balanced diet of Scripture.</p>

<p><strong>Clarity and Simplicity:</strong> Helm emphasizes the importance of clarity and simplicity in expositional preaching. The goal is not to impress with eloquent rhetoric or theological jargon but to communicate the message of the text clearly and understandably to the congregation.</p>

<p><strong>Gospel-Centered:</strong> Expositional preaching is inherently gospel-centered. Helm and 9Marks emphasize the importance of seeing Christ in all of Scripture and showing how each passage ultimately points to the redemptive work of Jesus Christ.</p>

<p><strong>Application:</strong> While faithful exposition is crucial, expositional preaching also emphasizes the practical application of Scripture to the lives of believers. Preachers are encouraged to help their congregations understand how the truths of Scripture should impact their beliefs, attitudes, and actions.</p>

<p><strong>Spiritual Growth:</strong> The ultimate aim of expositional preaching is the spiritual growth and maturity of the church. By faithfully teaching the Word of God, preachers seek to equip believers for a deeper understanding of Scripture, a stronger faith in Christ, and a life that reflects the character of God.</p>

<p>Overall, expositional preaching, as championed by David Helm and 9Marks, is characterized by its commitment to the authority of Scripture, its meticulous study of the text, its clear communication of biblical truths, and its emphasis on gospel-centered application for the transformation of lives and communities.</p>
