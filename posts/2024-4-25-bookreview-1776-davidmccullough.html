                <h2>Started Reading</h2>
                <p>Started reading April 12, 2024.</p>

                <h2>Written Review</h2>
                <p>Before I start, I will say this was HEAVY on the military battles and aspects of the Revolutionary War, I was blown away by the detail at which David McCullough was able to show in such simple to understand prose. GREAT JOB!</p>

                <p>This was an exceptional work, I am impressed. </p>

                <p>"1776" by David McCullough is a historical work that vividly recounts the pivotal year in American history when the thirteen colonies declared independence from British rule. McCullough's narrative shines as he brings to life the characters, who are in fact real people, more specifically those who played pivotal roles in shaping the fate of a fledgling nation. I was certainly immersed in the challenges, sacrifices, and triumphs of those who fought for American independence.</p>

                <p>One of the McCullough's greatest strengths is his use of showing multiple perspectives. He recounts both sides of the war, Starting the book with a description and example of King George III addressing Parliament. That's something I've never seen before. Then with the Revolutionary War, portraying not only the grand strategies of military commanders but also the gritty realities faced by soldiers on the ground. McCullough's portrayal of George Washington, in particular, offers a nuanced perspective on the revered Founding Father, highlighting his leadership amidst seemingly insurmountable odds. This was something that has gotten me excited in reading "George Washington: A Life by Ron Chernow". </p>

                <p>This book is a fairly methodical look into the military movements and ideas behind them, fascinating stuff really! There is so much here, from the freezing winter at Valley Forge to the adrenaline-fueled clashes on the battlefield, McCullough conveys the emotions and struggles of those who fought for freedom.</p>

                <p>Beyond its gripping narrative, "1776" also serves as an educational resource, and I really appreciate that. Coming into reading non-fiction I knew I was going to be doing some learning and wow, did I?! "1776" offers readers a deeper understanding of the events that shaped the American Revolution. McCullough's research is evident throughout the book, showing historical facts and insights into the personalities and motivations of key figures.</p>

                <p>"1776" illustrates the enduring spirit of perseverance and resilience that defined the American Revolution. Despite facing overwhelming odds, the patriots of 1776 remained steadfast in their commitment to liberty, inspiring future generations to cherish the freedoms they fought so valiantly to secure. I feel it is important to know how your country started. </p>

                <p>In conclusion, "1776" is a triumph of historical storytelling, offering readers a captivating and immersive journey through a pivotal moment in American history. David McCullough's narrative and meticulous attention to detail make this book a must-read for anyone interested in understanding the origins of the United States and the timeless ideals for which it stands.</p>
