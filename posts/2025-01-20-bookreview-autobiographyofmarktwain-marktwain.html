        <p>I decided to read my first autobiography, Mark Twain's, because I know very little about him. I plan to read Mark Twain by Ron Chernow later this year (May 2025), and I was eager to learn more about him. I likely read Twain in high school or middle school, but since so much time has passed, I thought it would be a good idea to revisit his work. So, I picked up The Adventures of Tom Sawyer and Adventures of Huckleberry Finn. I'm looking forward to reading those after finishing this autobiography. Wow, Mark Twain (Samuel Clemens) is an absolutely hilarious author!</p>

        <p>Twain famously dictated this autobiography, but he requested that it not be published until 100 years after his passing. He had a flair for the dramatic and certainly didn’t want anyone to get too comfortable with his thoughts while he was around. So, sure enough, Twain’s autobiography was released in 2010, exactly 100 years after his death in 1910.</p>
            
        <p>It’s one of those delightful twists that only Twain could have planned, leaving his readers to ponder and marvel at his wit long after he'd shuffled off this mortal coil. Quite fitting for a man who made a career of surprising everyone, even in death!</p>
            
        <p>Ah, what a curious and delightful way to put things! You see, there’s a certain joy in Mark Twain’s prose, a sort of sparkling wit that sneaks up on you like a clever fox. Why, every time I read one of his tales, specifically in his autobiography, it’s as if the words themselves are having a little chuckle behind my back. It’s not just humor—oh no—it’s a dry, sly, almost mischievous sort of humor, that makes you wonder if you’re not the butt of some very well-aimed joke.</p>
            
        <p>In fact, it’s hard not to be drawn to Twain’s style. It’s as though he wields his pen like a master craftsman, shaping language into something that doesn’t just tell a story, but reminds you of the ridiculousness of the world. Every line is laced with wit that sneaks in unexpectedly—like a joke told under the breath of a well-fed, well-meaning rascal. So if you’re a fan of Twain’s prose, you’ve surely discovered that humor and wisdom often walk arm-in-arm in his writing, and there’s no finer company to keep.</p>
            
        <p>Yes, it is indeed an exciting piece of history! The connection between Twain and Grant is a fascinating one. Mark Twain (then Samuel Clemens) and Ulysses S. Grant crossed paths at a time when both were navigating different paths in life. Twain, ever the shrewd businessman, recognized the value in Grant's memoirs and, as you mentioned, helped to publish them after Grant’s financial troubles.</p>
            
        <p>What makes this even more remarkable is that Twain took a personal interest in the project, not merely for profit, but because of his admiration for Grant. Twain's publishing house helped Grant finish and publish his memoirs, which became a literary and financial success. The fact that two such prominent figures in American history—one a revered general and the other a legendary writer—could collaborate so meaningfully is a perfect example of the unexpected ways history intertwines. It’s like something straight out of a story that Twain might have written himself!</p>
            
        <p>With that said, this was an incredibly enjoyable read. I love this, and I cannot wait to feast my eyes on more Twain -- no matter the "book bans based on language". That's something I'll certainly consider as I read more of Twain.</p>
