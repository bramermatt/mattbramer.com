<h2>Spoilers Ahead</h2>
<p>I am saying these <a href="#notes">Notes as I Read</a> are going to be spoilers if you've not read Winter's Heart yet! Please read at your own digression.</p>


<details id="story-breakdown">
    <summary>Story Spoiler Breakdown</summary>

<p><strong>Perrin</strong> is finally able to save Faile after an incredible bout and a smart plan devised with Seanchan, Asha'man, Two Rivers men, Aiel, and the Prophet's men invovled.</p>

<p><strong>Rand</strong> loses a hand from Semihrage who was masquarading as Tuon's Truthspeaker! Also is still having some struggles with LTT in his head is taking saidin away from him often. </p>
    
<p><strong>Loial</strong> is now married to Erith! And is on his way to the Great Stump in Stedding Shangtai to try and convince the Ogier to fight against the Shadow in the Last Battle.</p>
    
<p><strong>Mat</strong> oh Mat! Mat is now the Prince of the Ravens and has married Tuon! Mat is just awesome and a great general!</p> 

<p><strong>Elayne</strong> has gotten 12 Houses behind her and is now Queen of Andor.</p> 

<p><strong>Egwene</strong> is now beginning her campaign against Elaida within the White Tower! Even Novices are standing for her! This is going to be awesome!</p> 

<p><strong>Nynaeve</strong> ah, my favorite Nynaeve. She Healed Rand's hand to a stump. and sent Lan to World's End in Saldea and rides fro Tarwin's Gap to assult the Blight.</p>

<p><strong>Tuon</strong> is now the Empress, since her whole family has been murdered. WOW!</p>

<p><strong>The Forsaken</strong> heck, these Forsaken are doing some things, but not much this book.</p> 

<p><strong>The Last Battle</strong> is COMING SOON! THE PATTERN IS LOOSENING! The Dark One is touching the world more and more.</p>
    
<p><strong>Taim</strong> what is going on with Taim at the end of this book... Taim says "as the Old Saying goes, let the lord of chaos rule", why??? Why does he say this?!</p> 

<p><strong>The Salidar Aes Sedai + The Red Ajah Sitters</strong> are now going to start bonding male channeling Warders.. Asha'man. That is crazy, for them. For the most part, so far the Asha'man bonding Aes Sedai has been against their will, but now we are going to get consensual bonding of Aes Sedai and Asha'man and that is indicitive as "good" to me!</p>
    
<p><strong>Galad</strong> is the new Lord Captain Commander of the Whitecloaks after killing Eamon Valda! </p>

<p><strong>The Seanchan</strong> there are so much Seanchan in this book and there are a lot of alliances with the Seanchan for our Two Rivers boys. I'm worried about that, but here we go!</p>

    <summary>Spoiler Review</summary>
    <p>Oh what a victory lap from Robert Jordan with this book. An absolutly amazing book in this series. SO MANY RESOLUTIONS IN THIS BOOK, let's go through it all! And, most of this will be more from the Story Breakdown...</p>

<p><strong>Thom</strong> reveals to Mat that Moiraine is alive and being held captive by the Aelfinn and Eelfinn. They formulate a plan to infiltrate the Aelfinn and Eelfin using the Tower of Ghenjei thanks to Olver’s knowledge of the game of Snakes and Foxes. Mat and Noal agree to accompany Thom on his mission to save Moiraine. <strong>Perrin</strong> finally saves Faile.. FINALLY! She has been taken for three books now, and wow, finally we got the saving. <strong>Elayne</strong> is now Queen of Andor! <strong>Mat</strong> reunites with Talmanes and an even larger and better equipped Band of the Red Hand. Together they launch a campaign of guerilla warfare against the Seanchan army sent by Suroth to murder Tuon. They are found by Furyk Karede, who takes over protection of Tuon and gives Mat intelligence to destroy the Seanchan force. Before returning and assuming power in Ebou Dar, Tuon completes the marriage ceremony with Mat, making him the Prince of Ravens. <strong>Rand</strong> goes to meet with the Daughter of the Nine Moons, though he discovers it is Semirhage in disguise. Rand loses his hand in the confrontation, burned away by the Forsaken’s attack while Lews Therin battled him for control of saidin. Semirhage is taken captive. <strong>Both the rebel Aes Sedai and Red Sisters from the Tower</strong> send representatives to the Black Tower to bond Asha’man as Warders. <strong>Taim</strong> agrees and says, “Let the Lord of Chaos rule,” a phrase previously used by the Forsaken. WHAT COULD THAT MEAN?!</p>

<details id="predictions">
    <summary>Predictions and Theories</summary>

<p><strong>The Colors Swirling</strong> okay, this must be something to do with ta'veren, but I really don't know. It must have something to do with that because it's only the boys that have it (Rand, Mat, Perrin) but that's the only explanation I have for this. <strong>Perrin</strong> what happens next for Perrin since Faile is back? <strong>Rand</strong> my preference would be that Rand has no issues channeling, he doesn't have any nausa or is dizzy - I don't want that to happen anymore; that's the prediciton. <strong>Taim</strong> is a darkfriend, we know that. But WHY DOES HE KNOW LET THE LORD OF CHAOS RULE??? WHY??? That is all.  <strong>Noal</strong> I have had the prediction that Noal has some connection to Jain Farstrider (Charin), but Noal said Jain was his cousin and had his wife die. I felt that feeling from him taht what he was saying was true. I want to believe him so badly, but he could also be Jain Farstrider himself. <strong>Salidar Aes Sedai</strong> I WANT THE SEIGE ALREADY! Also, they basically realized Halima and Delana are Darkfriends of some capacity, because Narishma (Asha'man / Callandor) could feel a man channeling saidin trying to break his eavesdrop warding.. and Halima and Delana have snuck away. <strong>Moiraine</strong> is going to come back... in Towers of Midnight! Because Mat and Thom talk and finally get to read Moiraine's letter that talks about Moiraine needing Mat and Thom to go to the Tower of Genji to save her from the Aelfinn and Eelfin. <strong>Aelfinn + Eelfinn</strong> I want more of this, we haven't gotten much of that, other than what they are and where they might be. I'd really like to get more of a deep dive on that. <strong>Age of Legends</strong> I want more of this as well, we've heard a LOT OF THIS, but I just want more! <strong>Moridin</strong> I beleive is Ishamael, and we got some confirmation about that, but not a complete confirmation.. I have beleived this since Lord of Choas (book six) when the Watcher was first introduced.</p>

    <summary>Notes as I Read</summary>
<h2>Header</h2>
<p>"The sweetness of victory and the bitterness of defeat are alike a knife of dreams. —from Fog and Steel by Madoc Comadrin</p>

<h2>Prologue, Embers Falling on Dry Grass, Wheel and Snake</h2>
<p><strong>Galad.</strong> OH DANG! Galad is Lord Captain Commander of the White Cloaks and has gained a heron marked blade for killing Eamon Valda in Children of the Light challenge!! BOOM WHAT A START! </p>

<p>Galad is riding along a road in Amadicia with Trom, Dain Bornhald, and Jaret Byar. The Whitecloaks are now allied with the SC. They are heading to a manor house once belonging to Ailron that the SC gave to Eamon Valda. Galad plans to kill Valda. Bornhald an dByar told him that Valda assulted and killed Morgase. Trom and Galad have both been promoted to Lord Captain because three of the high officers were killed by ht eSC at Jeramel. At the manor there are 50 regular WC and half a dozen Questioners led by Rhadam Asunawa. Valda is angry with Trom because he is supposed to be headed to Nassad with other Lords Captain to meet with the SC. </p>

<p>Galad challenges Valda and Asunawa objects and wants to arrest Galad - Valda accepts. Galad studied under Henre Haslin and Gareth Bryne. Galad kills Valda after an awesome battle. Most of the WC claps, Asunawa and the Questioners are gone. They rode toward Nassad. Galad's supporters believe Asunawa has gone to talk the other Lords Captain into arresting him. Galad wants to seek other allies to oppose the SC. A Cairhienin named Doirellin and the others agree. Galad tells them they might have to ally with the AS and the Asha'man if they want to fight at The Last Battle. The men agree. Whitecloak law says it is allowable to ally with the serpent to fight the raven and Galad is now the new Lord Captain Commander.</p>

<p><strong>Ituralde.</strong> Sneaky plans Ituralde.. and I know none of them lol. </p>

<p>Rodel Ituralde leads 100 Domani and three hundred Tarabon. Tornay Lanasiet leads 200 Tarabon. They are near the village of Serana in Tarabon halfway between Elmora and Amadicia. There is a SC camp nearby. They ride into view of the camp surprising the SC and Tarabon there. The defenders mount a charge and seem to trample a few people in the field.. ghosts?? Lanasiet's men charge forward but Ituralde has his archers take out the SC command along with a sul'dam and damane. When the SC and Tarabon survivors flee, Lanasiet and his men chase. Jaalam rides up - there are no bodies on the field where the people were standing. Ituralde orders him to burn the warehouse. He has 20,000 men all over Tarabon on similar raids. He means to work his way north and re-gather his men, and he expects the SC to follow. They will fall into the trap he has set in Almoth Plain, if they see the trap he has a backup plan.</p> 

<p><strong>Suroth.</strong> Holy crap! Well so much for meeting the Empress lol. I have been wanting to meet the Empress for some books now, and now I guess I have already met her lololol. So Semirhage is using the Balzamon trick huh lol - that's awesome, I'm glad that's back! Suroth.. I am EXCITED TO SEE WHAT HAPPENS! The entire Imperial family, including the Empress Radhanan are dead, Seandar is in chaos and there is war from Aldael Mountains to Salaking.. "let the Lord of Chaos rule". Also Liandrin is here and is going to be collared! WOO! wait.. morally ambiguous lol. </p>

<p>Dawn is nearing in Ebou Dar and High Lady Suroth still cannot sleep. She wonders if Tuon is alive or dead. It has been seventeen days. She thinks the escape of the Atha'an Miere damane and death of Tylin mean Tuon is dead. Someone is trying to disrupt the Return. Two of her own sul'dam, Renna and Seta, disappeared at the same time. Egeanin Tamarath stole a pair of damane and also disappeared. If Tuon is, indeed, dead Suroth will have to apologize to the Empress. If that happens she will kill herself before reaching Seandar. She still has some hope. Tuon's der'sul'dam left nine days ago with all her sul'dam and damane. Captain Musenge left at the same time with many of his men. She worries that someone may suspect she is Atha'an Shadar, a Darkfriend.</p>

<p>The door opens and Liandrin enters dressed as da'covale. Almandaragal, her lopar, prepares to defend her. Liandrin professes her loyalty citing how she killed Alwhin. She brings a message from an officer of Captain-General Galgan to summon Suroth. Suroth thinks it is time to have a sul'dam collar Liandrin; she will send Elbar to find another Darkfriend.</p>

<p>She sends Liandrin to Rosala for a beating then goes to her anteroom where Banner-General Mikhel Najirah awaits. She has a screen decorated with a kori, a huge spotted cat from the Sen T'jore. He escorts her through the palace where Beslan is now king. Captain-General Lunal Galgan's ancestors date back to Luthair Paendrag Mondwin. He tells her that raken began arriving three hours ago with reports from Lieutenant-General Turan of dozens of raids in Tarabon. Rodel Ituralde was behind them. She orders them to bring her Ituralde's head. She orders Captain of the Air Yulan to put most of his raken on the hunt. He wants to save some for Banner-General Khirgan and to search for the Aiel and seven thousand deserter Whitecloaks in Amadicia. Galgan does not object as long as he has the to'raken he needs for Altara and Illian.</p>

<p>She returns to her rooms where Semirhage appears masked in fire. Semirhage offers to make her Empress. Suroth is terrified, but Semirhage tells her that Empress Radhanan and all the imperial family is dead. Seandar is in chaos and there is war from the Aldael Mountains to Salaking. She laughs and says, "Let the Lord of Chaos rule." Suroth is horrified that even one of the Da'concion, the Chosen Ones, could do that. Semirhage orders her to put all her efforts to killing Tuon and to expanding the rumor that she is an impostor. Suroth agrees. She will send Elbar with thousands of men.</p>

<p><strong>Pevara.</strong> Oh yes, Black Ajah plots! Pevara is ready to bond an Asha'man! I was pumped about this Supreme Council meeting that this crew is about to disrupt.. wow! Pevara wants to bring Zerah and the others to attack the meeting, BUT Yukiri convinces her it is a bad idea. They know now that Elaida's mission was to find treason in Alviarin, not hunt the BA.. lol. Also these Reds know that Damar Flinn has Healed the stilling! WOO! </p>

<p><strong>Alviarin.</strong> Alviarin retrieves a secret message and returns to her quarters. She is still overwhelmed by her experience with Shaidar Haran, the Great Lord in her eyes. The whole White Ajah is ashamed of her for being demoted from Keeper. She is still sore from her penances with Silviana. Katerine spread the news of Dumai's Wells through the Black Ajah. In her rooms she decodes the message and two others. One reports that Talene left the White Tower yesterday, before the Supreme Council meeting. Alviarin is now certain there was something between her and Yukiri and Doesine. Alviarin is afraid to call Mesaana who probably wants to kill her. She writes orders to find Talene and to keep close watch on Yukiri and Doesine.</p>

<p><strong>Galina.</strong> Can it be this book Faile is saved?? I am hopeful! Galina is gai'shain white now! She plans to get back at Elaida, Therava still owns her, and she can't channel without permission. She wants to get the Oath Rod to remove her obedience oaths.. then Gual and Neald pop in and remove her. She's brought back to Perrin's camp and talks with them going by the name Alyse. Perrin has Galina verify the accuracy of his maps of Malden and the surrounding Shaido camp. Perrin asks about what the Wise One's drink and if it's only water... they're going to poison the water-hole! I don't remember where that reference comes from lol. He asks her to warn Faile to go to Lady Cairen's fortress at the north end of the city and hide when she hears wolves during the day. Lying, Galina says she will. After retrieving her horse Neald takes her back to the Shaido camp. She is late and Therava punishes her. She plans to get the Oath Rod, kill Faile and her friends, and escape.</p>

<p><strong>Egwene.</strong> Oh yeah, I'm ready for this. But, really? We've stopped the progress or is everyone else going to start the siege now that Eg has been captured?? What are we going to do now?? </p>

<p>Eg is riding in a carriage through TV from Northarbor to the WT. 5 AS are with her Katerine, Barasine (REDS), Felaana (BROWN), Pritalle (YELLOW), Berisha (GRAY). They seem to be at each other's throats. Jala and Merym went ahead to report to Elaida. They forkrooted Eg. Eg tells them she converted the harbor chain to cuendillar.. wow! Nicola is there in novice white, Elaida wants Eg sent to Silviana. Nicola apologizes. Leane has been captured too, she converted half the chain there. Elaida has reduced Eg to novice, but otherwise nto punished her. Eg tells her she is a Dreamer and warns them of the coming SC attack. Eg is escorted back to the novice quaters and she enters TAR and she wants to warn Siuan and Eg is going to start working on the WT from within.</p>

<h2>Ch 1, When Last Sounds, TAR</h2>
<p><strong>Siuan.</strong> Oh this is very good! I’m excited now. See at the end of COT I didn’t really care that Eg was captured. I felt like it was just prolonging the plot from happening. Because, and this is my fault for thinking this, I thought the Salidar Aes Sedai would be storming the Tower and it would be a huge gigantic battle since there were a lot of soldiers and Aes Sedai and Novices. And now, I don’t know what is going to happen… Also, I absolutely love the wind starting from Dragonmount, what a powerful image. Feels like this is going to be a good book to me! Siuan’s ability to Heal is strong since Nynaeve Healded her.. interesting. Lelaine also wants to betray Egweene… yuck.</p>

<p>A wind rises at the peak of Dragonmount and carries a sulfurous smell east past the Salidar Aes Sedai camp and to the army camp where it wakes Siuan.  She lights a lantern with Fire. Bryne is still out and about. She is angry and confused about her feelings toward him. She sees that he blacked his own boots and angrily removes it with Earth, Fire and Air. Min told her she has to stay close to him. The sudden wind wrecked the camp and many people are injured. Her ability to Heal is strong since Nynaeve Healed her.</p>

<p>She borrows a horse, Nightlily, that belongs to Nemaris, a campfollower's wife. Nightlily is not as mild as Bela and she has a rough ride to the Salidar Aes Sedai camp. Arriving at the Salidar Aes Sedai camp she weaves Spirit to hide her ability to channel. She passes Sheriam's and Morvrin's dark tents and stops at Myrelle's. Three Warder, Arinvar, Avar Hachami, and Jori stand guard. She first weaves Air and a hint of Fire to eavesdrop but the tent is warded. She goes inside and finds Myrelle, Morvrin, Carlinya and Sheriam. Siuan reports the Egwene and Leane are alive and well and that they mostly succeeded. Beonin went to bed and they have ousted Nisao from their group. Sheriam wants to Travel to free them but Egwene ordered no rescue. They do not understand why Elaida did not order an immediate trial. Sheriam is still angry because Elaida abolished the Blue Ajah.</p>

<p>Lelaine Akashi enters. They tell her about Egwene and she asks Siuan to walk with her. Outside, Burin, Nuhel Dromand, Arinvar and Jori wait. Burin joins Lelaine. She tells Siuan that she uncovered Faolain's spying and kept her confined.  Siuan tells her that Egwene ordered a sitting of the Hall in the White Tower in Tel'aran'rhiod when Last sounds the next night. She keeps the betrayal a secret because someone in the Hall was the leak. Lelaine tells Siuan to support her for the Amyrlin against Romanda if Egwene dies or is stilled. Siuan worries that Lelaine now also has reason to betray Egwene. </p>

<h2>Ch 2, The Dark One’s Touch, Aes Sedai</h2>
<p><strong>Beonin.</strong> This is a neat perspective. Food is spoiling and Beonin thinks the Dark One is touching the world. She also thinks that Rand has much to answer for but the Dragon Reborn must win the LB. Beonin seized the moment when Elaida deposed Siuan and she has adjusted since then. The AS are all on edge because of the murders of Anaiya and Kaire.. duh lol. It’s Halima y’all. Both Anaiya and Kairen were Blues and had contact with Moraine and Rand… are we getting Moiraine this book???? Beonin suggests a connection with Asha’man. Beonin rides to the Traveling ground.. awesome! She weaves a gateway with Spirit to a grove near the WT, she loves weaving the gateway.. I agree it’s pretty awesome. When they arrive, she sees the ghost of Turanin Merdagon who died forty years ago when Beonin was Accepted. She weaves Illusion to disguise herself and sends her Warder Tervail to find and inn and she goes into the WT to find Elaida…. Why?</p>

<p><strong>Elaida.</strong> Mattin Stepaneos is not dead! Cool. He was kidnapped from Illian before Rand came and just arrived yesterday - Elaida has a plan to get him the crown back. Beonin comes in and tells Elaida about Egwene telling everyone she's alive and such. Then says she is good at the new Healing and then shows gateways for Traveling and Skimming. Elaida tells her not to tell anyone those weaves without her permission. Beonin tells her about the ten moles including Meidani and Elaida wants to have the moles watched and invite Meidani to dinner. Beonin can teach Tarna all the new weaves and Elaida orders Beonin to show her everything. Also the Wards are failing against rats lol. </p>

<p>Tarna enters and reports that Southharbor is only slightly functional. After the rebels are defeated Elaida intends to add their army to the Tower Guard. Gareth Bryne is a much better captain than High Captain Jimar Chubain. The streets of Tar Valon are filthy because workers are afraid of the ghosts. Elaida has studied writings on the Last Battle and the ghosts mean it is coming soon. She thinks she will soon have Elayne back in hand. There is news of Tarabon rebelling against the Seanchan. The Tar Valon sewers are clogged. There are rats in the White Tower; the Wards are failing. </p>

<h2>Traveling</h2>
<p>Okay I have a lot of thoughts. About the Ways and Traveling and Gateways and Skimming. This might sound a bit jumbled but here we go.. So, the Ways were created by male channelers right? or was it just the Aes Sedai at during the AOL? Anyways.. so my thought/prediction is the Ways / Waygates are a tied off wWeave / Standing weave / Keeping weave of a gaTraveling Gateway (not the instant jump from one place to another, but ) but a place that has bridges and walkways built up for walking... now with the Black Wind.. no idea on that lol. But that's my thought. Since non-channelers can use the Ways. Also, the use of the trefoil Avendesora leaf.. hmm. I don't know, but that is my thought and I'm excited to RAFO!</p>

<h2>Ch 3, At the Gardens, Forsnaken</h2>
<p><strong>Aran'gar.</strong> Holy smokes I haven't even read two pages and so many things have been revealed. WHOA! Alright. Aran'gar is Bathamel, because they talked about Aginor. And Moridin is Ishameael, at least Aran'gar has no doubt. I've been saying that since book seven! WOO! </p>

<p>So let’s go! The remaining Forsaken are in TAR, summoned by Moridin. Graendal, Demandred, Mesaana and Semirhage are there, there are 11 chairs. Asmo, Sammael, Be’lal, and Rahvin are dead, Osan’gar hasn’t been seen since SL (Winter’s Heart) - because he was killed by Elza! Zomara serve wine, Moridin / Ishamael found a stasis box with dozens of Zomaran. Aran’gar found two but they only heard rubbish, she is wearing an emerald necklace from Delana, Aran’gar is weak in TAR. She can only find Eg’s dream when she sleeps next to her. Graendal has a lot of Darkfriend contacts. Aran’gar propositions Graendal.. Mesaana is angry at Aran’gar because she lost Egwene and the rebellion will fall apart. Aran’gar tells her the rebellion is holding and Mesaana will wait until Elaida breaks Eg, Mesaana won’t tell where Eg is held. </p>

<p>Moridin comes in with Mogi and Cyndane (Lanfear!), Moridin is Nae’blis. Moridin says Sammael or someone disguised as him ordered 100 Fades and 1000s of Trollocs into the Ways. It must have been one of the Chosen, he doesn’t know their orders. Moridin orders them to order all Darkfriends to watch for them. Only Moridin knows what was done to Mesaana for punishment. Moridin orders them to locate the three remaining seals, he will not let Cyndane near Rand because she would kill him. No one but Moridin is to harm Rand. Graendal insists Cynd is too weak to be Lancer but Aran is sure she is. Moridin orders them to kill Mat and Perrin. He thinks it will be easy to find them because they are tavern. Graendal says finding tavern is not that simple and is harder since the whole Pattern is in flux. This is the first time Semirhage has seen their faces, Aran’ thinks Moridin will be disappointed over Rand.</p> 

<h2>Ch 4, A Deal, Seanchan</h2>
<p><strong>Perrin.</strong> Oh wow wow wow… I want an end to this Shaido plot, but I’m not dreading it any longer. It seems to be going on for sometime now and it seems we’re going to dose the water supply with fork root lol. Also, I really hope the SC don’t learn how to Travel.. but it seems like the SC are going to be on Perrin’s side and maybe Rand’s side if anything is to be believed at face value with all these bargains with the SC. HMMMMM. Also, the Prophecies of the Dragon “the fox will marry the raven”… MAT AND TUON! WOW! Also, the Wolf King with a Hammer.. hey hey Perrin - it’s part of the Pattern! I’ve also wondered similar things about Berelain and her relatives! Turns out she is a distant cousin of sorts.. neat!</p>

<p>Perrin goes to meet the SC mediated by Tallanvor - Berelain is with him. They meet Captain-General Bakayar Mishima and Banner-General Tyler Khirgan. Perrin thinks Hopper would laugh at a Wolf King. Tylee notes Berelain's surname Paendrag; she is descended from Artur Paendrag Tanreall. Berelain claims only Mayene but she will defend it proudly. To show the prowess of his men, Perrin raises a flat branch into the air. From the woods three hundred paces away Jondyn Barran and Jori Congar shoot arrows into it. Then Jur Grady raises it into the air and flash burns it. The damane Norie puts out a small grassfire and her sul'dam reports that it was an Asha'man. Tod hands Perrin the Manetheren banner and he offers it to Tylee saying he will relinquish all claim of restoring Manetheren in Emond's Field and the Two Rivers if she helps him free Faile. A sulfurous gale suddenly blows through startling everyone. Tylee sends her soldiers back and Perrin has Dannil and Tell do the same. Perrin tells Tylee that Sevanna and the Shaido have three to four hundred channeling Wise Ones. Tylee does not have the resources to face that many. She will have to disturb the Daughter of the Nine Moons and possibly apologize to the Empress. Mishima recalls the slaughter at Semalaren when there were four hundred damane on each side. Perrin heard that the Seanchan have something that knocks out channelers. He plans to put that in the Shaido water supply. Tylee says the manufactory is almost to Tarabon and she does not have the clout to get enough. Perrin says they can Travel and shows Tylee and Mishima the order from High Lady Suroth. Tylee is thoroughly impressed and wants to know who Perrin really is. He is a man who wants his wife back and will deal with the Dark One to get her. He and the Seanchan have a deal. </p>

<h2>Ch 5, Something…Strange, Wheel and Snake</h2>
<p><strong>Faile.</strong> Hey, not a bad Faile chapter lol. Alright, to summarize… there was something strange that happened…. It’s been a month since Faile was caught with a knife and nearly two months since she was captured. Rolan keeps saving her. Galina had her hair singed off from Theresa. Lusaka serves Theresa water, she and Aravine sworn to Faile in the last two weeks. I’m really interested to see the little things that happen after Perrin and crew poison the water! Therava tells Sevanna that many pet chiefs still try to use their nar’baha, Bendhuin of the Green Salts left for Rhuidean five days ago. There are 14 septs around Malden and two more, the Moral and the White Cliff are days away. Aravine arrives and reports that Alvin and his son Theril have something… it’s the Oath Rod that was in Theresa’s tent! Then Roman shows up and everyone leaves and he tells Faile that he and other Mer’adin (brotherless) plan to return tot he Aiel Waste - where he will take Faile with him! He will let her go when they make it into a town. File hides the OR in the town and Therava has discovered it was taken and starts a search! </p>

<h2>Ch 6, A Stave and a Arazor, Dice</h2>
<p><strong>Mat.</strong> Ahhh, I love this book. Mat buys astave of black yew to carve a longbow, Colors swirl and Mat sees Rand and Min kissing. There aren't ghosts today. Mat also buys a horse, a razor, after some bargaining he learned from his dad. Mat now calls Tuon Precious and Mat asks Noal if he is related to Jain Charin, and Noal says he was a cousin... uh oh! Olver's favorite book is The Travels of Jain Farstrider. Olver stays in a tent with Juilin and Thera. Noal says he was a fool who went on adventures while his wife died of fever. "He let himself be made into a tool by—" and then his face goes blank. Olver recalls that Jain Charin captured Cowin Gemallan after he betrayed Malkier to the Shadow. Juilin enters and reports that Seanchan soldiers have arrived. Woo.</p>

<h2>Ch 7, A Cold Medallion, A'dam</h2>
<p><strong>Mat.</strong> Bethamin (sul'dam) is channeling, Mat feels the fox medallion go cold, and he comes in and Joline is slapping Bethamin. Mat stops her and she slapps him, the other AS try to stop Mat and they are shocked about his foxhead medallion, Setalle asks if she can see the ter'angreal that he must have and she thinks that Cadsuane had one like it. She knows baout the test for the shawl as well. Edesina boud them with Air - they are going to train Bethamin or she would die. The dice are still rolling. </p>

<h2>Ch 8, Dragon's Eggs, Leaf / Tinkers!</h2>
<p><strong>Mat.</strong> With a title like Dragons' Eggs I thought we were getting an Elayne perspective hahahah, but that would've been Dragon('s) instead of Dragon(s') ah well here we go! Mat gets more colors of Rand with Loial and Rand eating... after hearing more rumors of Rand. Aludra needed a bellfounder to make bronze lofting tubes for her firewords - to avenge the Illumintors and attack the SC. She will call the tubes dragons and the charges dragons' eggs. Aludra agrees to go with Mat and one set of the dice stop rattling. Mat gives Tuon the razor horse - another set of the dice stop. They come up to a Tinker caravan and Tuon gallops off. Tuon names the razer Akein (swallow). There are some ruins ahead and Mat sees some hills he recognizes as The Dancers and knows this was Londaren Cor, the capital city of Eharon. He also remembers dying in a battle near the hills when Nerevan and Esandara invaded Shiota. Mat wonders how the Eelfinn collected memories from dead men. Mat thinks they must create a link so they must still be in his head, too. I WANT MORE OF THIS PLEASE!!! Selucia catches up and says the TuathaAn are following. Mat talks with the Seeker while Tuon and Selucia talk with the women. The TuathaAn are heading toward Ebou Dar because they have heard the Seanchan offer safety. TuathaAn take their women who can channel straight to Tar Valon. After appeasing the TuathaAn, Mat, Tuon and Selucia ride back to the circus.</p>

<h2>Ch 9, A Short Path, Wheel and Snake</h2>
<p><strong>Mat.</strong> Oh yeah, go Mat! So, Setalle was once Aes Sedai - yep I could've guessed that lol. Mat does something incredible and saves Joline and Teslyn from the a'dam and then buries them.. awesome!</p>

<p>Luca lets slip to the Aes Sedai that Tuon is a High Lady and they begin badgering her to negotiate a truce with the Seanchan. One evening Lopin and Nerim prepare supper for Mat, Tuon, Selucia, Noal and Olver. After Olver leaves, Noal tells stories about the Seven Towers in Malkier and Shol Arbela, the City of Ten Thousand Bells, in Arafel. Joline, Teslyn and Edesina enter and demand that she end the war before Tarmon Gai'don. Selucia slips an a'dam onto Teslyn and in the confusion puts one on Joline as well. Tuon has the bracelets. Edesina tries to run but Tuon binds her with Air and slams the door on Blaeric and Fen. Tuon demonstrates the a'dam on Joline. Mat tries to talk her into letting them go but she refuses. He moves toward them and the foxhead medallion grows cold. Tuon is shocked. Mat releases Teslyn then makes all three agree to stop annoying Tuon. Then he releases Joline. Mat buries the three a'dam in a deep hole and gets soaked with a cold rain for his trouble. The dice are still tumbling in his head.</p>

<h2>Ch 10, A Village in Shiota, Snake and Foxes</h2>
<p><strong>Mat.</strong> HOLY CRAP. DUDE. HOLY CRAP. MOIRAINE IS COMING BACK. GOOD LORD. I AM SCREAMING. I LOVE THIS SO MUCH. WOW WOW WOW. THIS WAS A PERFECT CHAPTER. WOW WOW WOW WOW WOW WOW. Let me collect myself and come back to write what the heck just happened lol.</p>

<p>Tuon is rekindling Mat's memories about the Aelfinn and Eelfin.. I love this. And then they come to a village and it MELTS INTO THE GROUND?! Ghosts, right? lol The circus will continue to Lugard. Mat asks Thom about his letter and it was in fact the letter from Moiraine and as follows... The letter says Thom should show it to Mat only when he asks. She writes that she will confront Lanfear shortly but she will not die. Thom, Mat and one other must try to rescue her. Mat knows the way. She wishes the best for Lan and Nynaeve. Remember the game of Snakes and Foxes. Mat is not sure; he saw the twisted red doorway melt. And then Olver says Birgitte told him the Tower of Ghenjei is the way to the Aelfinna and Eelfin!! YES YES YES CALLBACK! To enter you have to draw the Snakes and Foxes sign on it with a bronze knife to open the door! Noal mentioned Jain thought it was on the Shadow Coast?? Mat recognizes the description as the tower he saw after feleing Shadar Logoth, Domon can lead them there. Mat warns them about the Ael and Eel and tells them the whole story, Noal offers to be the third and the dice stop as Mat agrees.... YES!</p>

<p>Mat sees ravens fly by and tells Tuon they could be spies for the Dark One. Tuon thinks it is a children's tale and asks if Mat believes that, if you sleep on Old Hob's Hill under a full moon, the snakes will give you true answers to three questions, or that foxes steal people's skins and take the nourishment from food so you can starve to death while eating your fill? Mat is startled at these references to the Aelfinn and Eelfinn. Old Hob, Caisen Hob, was a name for the Dark One in Shandalle where Artur Hawkwing was born. </p>

<p>They come to an odd looking village and see a peddler driving his wagon through. Mat recognizes the houses as ancient Shiotan construction. The village starts to melt into the ground. The peddler and his horses scream as they sink into the ground as well. Soon nothing is left but the road. Teslyn, Edesina, Joline, Blaeric and Fen examine the area but find nothing. People are scared to continue. Luca argues that they should continue to Lugard but most want to go back to Ebou Dar, Illian or somewhere west. Thom, Juilin, Amathera, Noal and Olver join Mat. Thom bets Mat that Luca will convince the circus to continue to Lugard and he wins. Luca and Latelle lead the troupe forward at a gallop. Tuon says the dead walking is a sign of Tarmon Gai'don.</p>

<p>That evening Lopin and Nerim serve dinner but no one eats much and Mat sends them to join Harnan and the Redarms. Domon and Egeanin invite Juilin and Amathera to their tent for a drink. They are all changing, becoming more accepting.</p>

<p>Thom reads his letter from Moiraine and Mat finally asks him about it. The letter says Thom should show it to Mat only when he asks. She writes that she will confront Lanfear shortly but she will not die. Thom, Mat and one other must try to rescue her. Mat knows the way. She wishes the best for Lan and Nynaeve. Remember the game of Snakes and Foxes. Mat is not sure; he saw the twisted red doorway melt. Olver says Birgitte told him the Tower of Ghenjei is a way to the Aelfinn and Eelfinn. Draw the Snakes and Foxes sign on it with a bronze knife to open the door. Noal says Jain Farstrider thought it was on the Shadow Coast. He describes it and Mat recognizes the description as the tower he saw after fleeing Shadar Logoth. He says Domon can lead them there. He warns them that the Aelfinn and Eelfinn know what is in his mind and tells them the whole story. Noal offers to be their third. Mat agrees to go and the final set of dice in his head stop.</p>

<h2>Ch 11, A Hell in Maderin, Dice</h2>
<p><strong>Mat.</strong> Tuon wants to go to an Inn. They go to one, The White Ring, Mat dices to a game (Match) a game popular 1,000 years before Artur Hawkwing (his memories). Mat is playing against three Altaran merchants Camrin, Kostelle and Vane, and a Taraboner merchant, Mistress Alstaing. Vane leaves suddenly. After they return to their table, Thom returns with news that the gholam killed in Jurador. Mat recalls he can fight it with the foxhead medallion. </p>

<p>There is also a Seanchan army ahead on the border of Murandy. They make anyone passing through drink an herbal tea. The sul'dam collar anyone who gets wobbly. (THIS IS AN INCREDIBLY SMART IDEA ON THE SC PART). They are also looking for a Tuon impostor. They begin planning to leave Luca and the circus. They will take Vanin and the redarms as well as Aludra. Mat wants to head east if Vanin knows a pass through the mountains.</p>

<p>When Tuon and Selucia return, Mat and Thom hustle them out of the inn. Tuon thinks the plot may be engineered by her sisters Ravashi or Chimal. Aurana is too young. Mat promises to get her to safety. Suddenly several approaching men pull their swords and attack. Together they kill all the attackers. Tuon kills the only woman. Mat recognizes one of the men as Vane. Out of nowhere, Thom apologizes for seeing things that cannot be and Selucia nods, Thom must've seen that Selucia was an awesome fighter! Having killed a local merchant, Mat realizes they must leave immediately and abandon Luca's circus. WOO! But what about Aludra?? And every single other person that are supposed to be with Mat? </p>

<h2>Ch 12, A Manufactory, Wolf</h2>
<p><strong>Perrin.</strong> Perrin and crew go into a town Almizar.. and talk to some Seanchan. Faile has been prisoner fifty-one days. Perrin is showing off that Suroth note to all the Seanchan peeps. People are dying to beetles and then Perrin's crew is getting some raken and a LOT OF FORKROOT! Also, Perrin's eyes are noticed and then a darkfriend tries to kill him with an arrow and... ta'veren! </p>

<p>Perrin is sure she must be alive because Alyse is protecting her. Perrin thinks of Mat and sees an image of him riding into a forest. There are numerous Tinker caravans camped near the town - Elyas told him that such large gatherings are rare except at their annual Sunday meeting. Neald scoffs at the TuathaAn for cowards but Perrin defends them telling how they protected the children when Trollocs attacked Emond's Field. Carlon Belcelona holds Stayer and Perrin and the Seanchan enter a large farmhouse that serves as the Seanchan military headquarters. The commander is Captain Blasic Faloun.</p> 

<p>As Khirgan asks to speak with him in private, a clerk named Mehtan vomits beetles until only his skin is left. Everyone is in terror shouting that it is Soulblinder's work. Faloun orders another clerk, Atal, to clean up the mess then escorts the newcomers to his office. Khirgan demands some of his fliers and, after Perrin shows Suroth's letter, they agree on four raken and twelve morat'raken. Faloun also happens to have a fine map of Altara that he gives them.</p>

<p>Camaille and Barmanes wait for Perrin outside. Now they head into town to get forkroot and a'dam. Balwer has not yet learned who rules Amadicia now that Ailron is dead. There are Hunters of the Horn in town. Perrin recalls that Moiraine had the Horn of Valere carried to the White Tower. A man notices Perrin's eyes and darts away. Khirgan leads them to a stone stable. Perrin and Khirgan enter. It is a forkroot manufactory. Using Suroth's letter they convince the Seanchan noble in charge to give them all the prepared forkroot, almost five thousand pounds. As they leave, Perrin turns in his saddle just as an arrow glances off his chest and pierces his arm. Mishima takes off for the men on top of a nearby building. Camaille and Barmanes remove the arrow and Khirgan apologizes for not protecting him better. Neald comes forward but Perrin tells him to wait till later. Khirgan is shocked that he would let someone use the One Power on him. Mishima returns. The men on the roof took poison and are already dead. Perrin thinks it might be the Forsaken. They head for an inn so Neald can Heal Perrin.</p>


<h2>Ch 13, Siege, Lion</h2>
<p><strong>Elayne.</strong> The siege is on! Do we trust this Lieutenant Chalz Guybon.. no. I don't. </p>

 <p>Elayne thinks she is not in danger because of Min's viewing that her babies will be born healthy. Birgitte orders the mercenaries to kill the fleeing attackers but they do not readily respond. The head of the mercenaries, Rhys a'Balaman, knows Aldin Miheres, who headed the attacking force. He explains that mercenaries will not pursue retreating foes because their positions may be reversed in the next battle. Mistress Harfor learned that Arymilla is trying to bribe some mercenaries. Elayne wishes she know how Mat, Thom and Olver are doing. She wishes she had Gareth Bryne but she knows Egwene needs him. A huge thunderstorm appears out of nowhere directly above the Inner City blocking view of the Royal Palace. Aviendha weaves Air, Fire, Water and Earth to slowly disperse the storm. Soon it is an ordinary rain. The Kin women open a gateway back to the main stableyard and everyone rides through. Several of the Kin have run away recently. Elayne thinks Nynaeve put too much backbone into them. In the stableyard another gateway is open and Queen's Guards ride through led by Lieutenant Charlz Guybon. Captain Kindlin in Aringill let him come to Caemlyn after Naean and the others escaped. He recruited men discharged by Gaebril and other loyal armsmen on the way, nearly ten thousand total. Mistress Zigane of the Kin found them and brought them by gateway. Elayne is delighted and promotes him to Captain. Birgitte makes him her second in command. They all go inside to dry off.</p>


<h2>Ch 14, Wet Things, Sea Folk (I want this as a tattoo lol)</h2>
<p><strong>Elayne.</strong> Elayne is still wet. uh, there are three mercenary captains waiting for Elayne, Mellar, Careane and Sareitha are with them - Elayne doesn't trust Mellar, and she also thinks Merilille, Careane, or Sareitha are Black Ajah. One sul'dam Marli Noichin can see the weaves, there are 28 more to go, Marli insists on being collard, Elayne wants to send the broken sul'dam back to SC. </p>

<p>They continue toward Elayne's quarters and then run into Chanelle din Seran White Shark and Renaile din Calon. They still wear mourning stoles for Nesta. They want to know about Talaan and Merilille. Elayne testily replies that every inn has been searched so they must have left Caemlyn. If the Windfinders do not return to their duties bringing in stores they will be breaking Zaida's bargain. Chanelle orders Renaile to go to The Silver Swan herself. There are nine sisters there at present. They would not tell Sareitha and Careane anything. Chanelle leaves to Travel to Tear. Once again Elayne heads for her apartments to dry off.</p>

<h2>Ch 15, A Different Skill, Aiel</h2>
<p><strong>Elayne.</strong> Whoa, this was cool! I can't beleive we are getting new things so late in the game, but I'm happy for it! So for some reason the cooridors are different to lead Elayne to her apartments.. Also, Avi is going back with Nadere and Dorindha back to the Wise One's on a secret mission.</p>

<p>In her apartments Essande, Sephanie Pelden and Naris await. Naris goes for food while Essande and Sephanie help them change. Aviendha has plenty of dresses, gifts from Tylin. When her pregnancy bothers her, Elayne sometimes regrets not drinking heartleaf tea before lying with Rand. Aviendha toys with the dull dagger ter'angreal. She thinks it prevents the Shadow from seeing the possessor, not the Eyeless or the Shadowtwisted, maybe not even Leafblighter. Aviendha cannot make ter'angreal but Elayne realizes she has a different Talent, identifying ter'angreal. THAT IS AWESOME! </p>

<p>They hurry to the sitting room where Elayne keeps the other ter'angreal from Ebou Dar, cups and bowls, statuettes and figurines, jewelry, all manner of things. Despite Min's viewing of her babies' safety, Elayne can no longer study them because of her poor grasp at the One Power. The ter'angreal are safe there as Reene Harfor has eliminated most of the dishonest servants. Aviendha examines other articles. The flexible black rod causes a controllable level of pain. The metal helmet controls some sort of machine. The ivory box holds music, hundreds of tunes. A flattish white bowl almost a pace across is for looking at things that are far away. A tall vase gathers water out of the air. A black-and-white figurine of a bird with long wings spread in flight is for talking to people a long way off. So is a blue figure of a woman as well as numerous rings, earrings and bracelets. A dull black rod is for cutting metal or stone. A glass figure of a man will chase away vermin. A root-like carving is for growing something like holes. It is activated by singing. A two foot statue holds thousands and thousands of books. Aviendha channels Fire and Earth into the figure and the Old Tongue words Ansoen and Imsoen, Lies and Truth, Fiction and Not Fiction, appear above it.</p>

<p>Nadere and Dorindha enter. They have come for Aviendha. The clan is leaving at the orders of the Car'a'carn to Bael. Aviendha hurriedly leaves to change clothes and pack. Naris arrives with food. Inspecting the meal, Nadere wants to know who is taking care of Elayne. Monaelle is Melaine's midwife. Essande offers that her niece Melfane is a midwife.</p>

<p>Elayne wants to choke Rand but all she knows of him is that he is somewhere far to the southeast. Aviendha returns in Aiel garb with a packed bundle and gives the dull dagger back to Elayne. Elayne gives Aviendha the amber turtle angreal and the twisted ring. She still has the seated woman and the silver ring, another dream ter'angreal that requires channeling Spirit. It was recovered from Ispan. Aviendha, Dorindha, and Nadere leave. Elayne goes to meet with the mercenaries.</p>

<h2>Ch 16, The New Follower, Darkfriend</h2>
<p><strong>Elayne.</strong> A cutpurse named Samwil Hark is going to follow Mellar, not after Elayne weaves Spirit and lays a Finder on his clothing and sends him away - only Elayne will be able to find him. Elayne is sure Mellar is a villain, she's had people follow Mellar and the first five have already died. She is certain Mellar was put in place to either spy on her or arrange her kidnapping and she is determined to get his master. She knows he faked the kidnap attempt that brought him to her attention Also, Dyelin is to meet Elayne in the Map Room.</p> 

<p>The mercenaries are Evard Cordwyn, Aldred Gomaisen, and Hafeen Bakuvun. Elayne sends Mellar away, clearly annoying him. Bakuvun acknowledges that he knew Mellar years ago. The mercenaries wish the Aes Sedai would leave; they have been badgering the mercenaries about the power of the White Tower. The mercenaries requested the audience because they have been losing men and want more money. Cordwyn pinches the maids. Elayne still needs them even with the men Guybon brought. Even so, Elayne angrily refuses to give in. Sareitha and Careane remind them that the White Tower will back Elayne over Arymilla. Elayne has a hard time believing one of them or Merilille is Black Ajah. The mercenaries leave and Elayne asks the Aes Sedai and Guardswomen to leave also. I'd also really like to trust Sareitha and Careane, but Elayne thinks against that.. I get it, people died lol.</p>


<h2>Ch 17, A Bronze Bear, Wheel and Snake (seeing this one a lot this book)</h2>
<p><strong>Elayne.</strong> I am really struggling with enjoying this plotline lol. I want to enjoy it so badly, but this has been such a slow build up I think someone important needs to die, or something drastic needs to happen. We are just farting around and very inconsequential things are happening.. ahhh. So the Palace corridors begin shifting and disappearing, causing unease in Caemlyn. An army of 200,000 Borderlanders and another of 60,000 unaffiliated Andorans approach the city. Yep.</p>

<p>Arymilla. Dinner occurs with Naean, Elenia, Nasin, Sylvase, Lir, and Karid. Jarid is High Seat of Sarand. Lir and Karind want to press with an all out attack. Arymilla wants to save her troops to fight the Borderlanders. All the food is spoling. Arymilla thinks Ellorien and possibly Aemlyn, Arathelle and Pelivar will side with her. She plans for Elayne and Dyelin to die. She thinks she can coerce Conail Northan and the other three children High Seats to publish support for her. If she cannot then Jaq Lounalt can. A servant bearing Marne's four Silver Moons enters with a message from Master Jakob Hernvil, Arymilla's secretary. Outside, he reports that "they have agreed, but they want all the gold up front." She orders him to draw up a letter to Mistress Andscale for her to sign. She orders him to tell them a week from tomorrow. In a week the throne will be hers. She goes back inside to tell the others the good news.</p>

<h2>Ch 18, News for the Dragon, Dragon</h2>
<p><strong>Rand.</strong> Well I'm happy. I do find it interesting about the madness and diziness in Rand's head. I wanted Rand to have an easy time channeling and embracing the Source but, it seems that's not the case. I guess I'll just have to wait and see. ALSO LOIAL IS GOING TO BE MARRIED, I love that. I love Loial. Also, I trust Logain. I don't trust Taim. Nynaeve says a storm is coming, could you say "a gathering storm"? Who is this blue eyed face with a square jaw Rand sees after their streams crossed at SL?? Also, I love that the Maidens are back with Rand, even though there are only 50. Also, I'm really interested to see how this all plays out with the SC. Mat has Tuon, Perrin is getting some SC behind him, and Rand is getting them too. This Last Battle thing is going to be pretty epic huh?</p> 

<p>Rand and Loial finish lunch at Lord Algarin's manor house. Lord Algarin left for the Black Tower. It is pouring rain. Loial continues to quiz Rand and take notes for his book. He is trying to grow a beard. He is disappointed because Rand does not elaborate on events like the fall of Illian and the cleansing of the True Source. Nynaeve and Alivia are there. Nynaeve still wears all of her jewelry set ter'angreal and her strange bracelet and rings angreal. Harilin of the Iron Mountain Taardad and Enaila of the Jarra Chareen stand guard. There are fifty Maidens at the manor house including some Shaido. Rand goes through the litany of women who died for him, Moiraine Damodred, Liah of the Cosaida Chareen, Sendara of the Iron Mountain Taardad, Lamelle of the Smoke Water Miagoma, Andhilin of the Red Salt Goshien, Desora of the Musara Reyn.</p>

<p>He wakes Min muttering the list at night. Lews Therin sometimes chants it. Min reads one of Herid Fel's books. With Min, Elayne and Aviendha bonded to him he wonders how to keep them safe. Verin and Cadsuane are there. Rand thinks of Mat and Perrin. He sees an image of Mat talking with a small, dark woman and leading a line of folks through forest.  He sees an image of Perrin with a man and woman in uniforms.  He can suppress the images if he wants. He is angry because he needs them and they are off for a day at the Ansaline Gardens.</p>

<p>Another image forms, the stranger who saved his life at Shadar Logoth when he fought Sammael. He and Lews Therin both think the man was aware of them as if they were touching.  Rand thinks their streams of balefire crossing created a link of some sort. He knows the other man used the True Power so he must be a Darkfriend but not one of the Forsaken as Lews Therin remembers all their faces.</p>

<p>Lews Therin moans about the voice in his head and Ilyena. He wants to die to join her. Lanfear and Ishamael knew how to track ta'veren by their effect on the Pattern.  No one else has found him that way since they died. Nynaeve delves Rand to make sure he is okay. Many servants are sick because of bad food. She has no more success Healing the wound in his side than Flinn. Ethin enters and announces that Lord Logain has returned.</p>

<p>Logain enters. He reports on the status of Caemlyn, the Borderlanders and the Black Tower. Arymilla still holds her siege on Elayne. Bashere has not returned yet. The Borderlanders have thirteen Aes Sedai with them. He does not know what they want but they have ties to the White Tower and Elaida certainly still wants him. Ethin leaves. Cadsuane helped capture both Logain and Taim. Logain was a minor noble in Ghealdan but King Johanin and the Crown High Council stripped him of his land and title when he became a false Dragon. Following Rand's orders Logain sent Asha'man to Arad Doman as well as Illian, more than half the Black Tower including all those with bonded Aes Sedai except for the ones with Rand.</p>

<p>Dobraine and Rhuarc will send a messenger as soon as they find someone in charge in Arad Doman. The Council of Merchants claim Alsalam is still King but no one can find him. Bandar Eban is in chaos. Rand will have to appoint a steward for Arad Doman but he does not know who. Taim is angry that Logain took so many men and that he does not know where Rand is. There are forty-one full Asha'man with Taim now and fifty more in his special classes. Min still sees an aura of glory around Logain. Rand cannot spend time worrying about Logain and Taim because he has to deal with the Seanchan and Tarmon Gai'don. Rand and Logain start arguing and Cadsuane tells them to be civil. Verin pipes up that the signs indicate the Last Battle is coming soon. Rand asks Cadsuane what she thinks of his plan. She thinks his peace with the Seanchan will be unpopular. He reminds her it is just a truce and only with the Dragon Reborn. When he is gone they can start their war again. Cadsuane is still doubtful. </p>

<p>Rand tells her one of his answers from the Aelfinn in the twisted red doorway. When he asked how he can win the Last Battle they answered: "The north and the east must be as one. The west and the south must be as one. The two must be as one." He actually asked how to win and survive. The last part of his answer was: "To live, you must die."</p>

<p>He thinks it means he should let the Seanchan hold the west and south and ally with them. She asks why he is reinforcing Illian and moving an army to Arad Doman. He wants armies in place to fight in case the Seanchan will not agree to a truce. Rand just figured out what the Prophecies of the Dragon meant with, "He must bind the Daughter of the Nine Moons to him." He expects Bashere to return soon with plans for their meeting. Cadsuane tells him he must be flexible rather than hard.</p>

<p>Ethin enters again and announces that three Ogier have arrived including Loial's mother Covril daughter of Ella daughter of Soong. The other two must be Elder Haman and Erith. Loial is distraught but Cadsuane tells him to go see her. They are in the Ogier sitting room upstairs. He is sure Erith will take him back to Stedding Tsofu so he will not be able to finish his book. Loial reluctantly leaves. Verin goes to find Tomas and Nynaeve goes to find Lan. The storm outside is letting up but Nynaeve says a terrible storm is coming.</p>

<h2>Ch 19, Vows, Trollocs! </h2>
<p><strong>Loial.</strong> I. LOVE. THIS. I love this so much. Loial is awesome, but he is sad he can't see the human ghosts and he has not yet seen any Ogier ghosts. Verin seems to know a lot about the recent events. He goes to the Ogier quaters, and thinks its strange Cadsuane knows his mother, Covril - Ella - Soong. Haman and Erith are there. Loil thinks Erith is beautiful. Covril and Haman are angry about their journey. Covril decided she must return to the Great Stump and they headed back to Shangtai. Erith tells Loial he was heroic in closing the Menetheren Gate and then rescuing Rand. Haman marries Loial and Erith on the spot. </p>

<p>Covril wants to leave immediately for Stedding Shangtai but Elder Haman insists on staying the night. The Great Stump is debating opening the Book of Translation which will take the Ogier to another world. Loial wishes he could address the Great Stump and argue that the Ogier should stay and fight the Shadow as they did in the Trolloc Wars. Loial looks out the windows and sees an army of Trollocs coming. He and Elder Haman pick up axes while Erith and Covril pick up long knives, then they go to warn Rand. I am VERY interested in this Book of Translation! And YES LOIAL GO LOIAL! Here we go... thousands of Trollocs! LET'S GO! </p>

<p><strong>Rand.</strong> HOLY MOLY. That was insane. Oh oh - Rand and Cadsuane both detect Shadowspawn. Also Bashere’s Saldaeans are trapped in the outbuildings - that’ll be important in a sec. The army of Trollocs are seen. Rand seizes saidin but when the dizziness hits him Lews Therin takes control. Rand then identifies the pins with some crazy names lol. LTT begs to see his hands… this was crazy! Then channels Earth, Air and Fire in Blossoms of Fire. He weaves Spirit touched with Fire for a gateway but then adds touches of Earth for Deathgates. Apparently - Traveling kills Shadowspawn, that’s going to be important. This, I believe is going to be an incredibly important weave Rand and Logain and some Asha’man just learned. Rand raises his hands so he can see them and Lews Therin weaves Fire and Earth for Arrows of Fire. The Trollocs try to break into the outbuildings and some are on fire.</p>

<p>Logain quenches some of the fires. Lews Therin is focused only on killing. Eventually all the Trollocs are dead. Harilin, Enaila and Min are still ready to fight. </p>

<p>Logain releases saidin and asks why Rand did not teach him the fancy weaves sooner. Is he playing favorites like Taim? Lews Therin will not release saidin, moaning that he wants to join Ilyena. Lews Therin remembers dying and starts to draw too much saidin. </p>

<p>Logain takes note and everyone is worried. Cadsuane grills Min on how Rand is feeling because she knows of their bond. Rand warns Cadsuane not to threaten Min again. Rand tells Lews Therin that they can die together at Tarmon Gai'don and he reluctantly releases. Cadsuane knows even before Logain tells her. </p>


<h2>Ch 20, The Golden Crane, Ravens</h2>
<p><strong>Rand.</strong> Yep, I like this book. Logain says Gabrelle and Toveine have worn themselves out. The fewer than twelve Asha'man and fewer than twenty Aes Sedai are working to incinerate the thousands of corpses. They think the Trollocs came from the Spine of the World through the Waygate at Stedding Shangtai. The Aes Sedai refuse to teach new weaves to Alivia but she is still learning fast just by watching. Rand thinks someone knows Ishamael's trick of tracking ta'veren, or maybe the blue-eyed man can locate him. The True Source is now clean, but with the wounds in his side from Ishamael and Padan Fain Rand wonders if he is. A serving man even older than Ethin brings Rand a letter from Verin. The nineteen dead Saldaeans are laid out in a barn; they do not bury their dead in the rain. Suddenly they are covered in flies. Alivia weaves and they all fly out the door. Cadsuane notes that she learns fast. Min thinks she had viewings about Moiraine that were wrong because she is dead. Rand reads Verin's letter. She left taking Tomas with her. She says to trust Cadsuane and heed her advice, but be wary of everyone else.</p>

<p>Loial and Elder Haman come outside. Loial says he married Erith and Rand congratulates him. Loial promises that he will be there for Rand at Tarmon Gai'don. Rand sealed the Waygates at Caemlyn, Cairhien, Illian and Tear. He put a trap on the open one near Fal Dara. He could not find the one near Far Madding. He needs Loial now to locate the others. Elder Haman insists that Loial must return to Stedding Shangtai to speak at the Great Stump but he volunteers to take up the task himself. Rand says he will take them to Stedding Shangtai the next morning.</p>

<p>Elza Penfell arrives with Davram Bashere. Two of the dead Saldaeans are Kirkun and Ahzkan. Bashere and Karldin Manfor met with High Lady Suroth. They were not allowed to talk with anyone else. The Daughter of the Nine Moons will meet with Rand at a manor house in northern Altara. She will bring six sul'dam and damane and no one else. Rand can bring five other channelers and one other woman to make the numbers even.</p>

<p><strong>Nynaeve.</strong> Whatcha doin Nynaeve? What’s at World’s End? Is she just trying to protect Lan?? </p>

<p>Nynaeve is resting from channeling too much. She took willow bark for her headache. She always wears the bracelet and rings angreal and the jewelry set ter'angreal. One of her rings with a pale green stone detects saidar and saidin. Another with a flawless sapphire turns cold when someone nearby is hostile or angry. Lan is there. It still grates on her that Myrelle holds his bond. </p>

<p>She avoids the other Aes Sedai because they supported Elaida. They are linked in pairs using saidar and saidin Fire to incinerate corpses. Lan is angry that Rand is negotiating with the Seanchan instead of convincing King Easar to return to guarding the Blight. The Last Battle will be there and at Shayol Ghul. In the Trolloc Wars the Shadow used Tarwin's Gap to move large armies of Trollocs. Nynaeve offers to take him to the Borderlands but first makes him swear to ride to Fal Moran before he enters the Blight and to allow anyone who wishes to ride with him. He agrees. In the stables they mount Mandarb and Loversknot.</p>

<p>Outside she weaves a gateway and they lead the horses through. Lan realizes they are not in Shienar. They are at World's End, in Saldaea as far from Fal Moran as possible. Nynaeve reminds him of his oath, hurriedly rides through a new gateway and lets it close.</p> 

<p><strong>Weilin Aldragoran.</strong> Chills. I have chills.. could be that it's just cold in here, but WHOA! "THE GOLDEN CRANE FLIES FOR TARMON GAI'DON! THE GOLDEN CRANE FLIES FOR TARMON GAI'DON!" So good. This was a neat perspective, I was like who is this Aldragoran fella, and then.. BOOM! Weilin Aldragoran deals jewels and wears the hadori of his Malkier heritage even though he lived almost his whole life in Saldaea, his wife Alida is Saldaean. Managan and Gorenellin are also jewel merchants of Malkier heritage, but they don't wear the hadori. Nynaeve shows up, what a boss,and she is young and wearing her red ki'sain, he thinks few Malkier go to the WT since the AS failed Malkier. She wants him to send messages to other merchants with pigeons that the Last Battle is coming. She shows him Lan's ring and names herself Nynaeve ti al'Meara Mandragoran - Lan Mandragoran rides from World's End toward Tarwin's Gap, toward Tarmon Gai'don and will he ride alone? Aldragoran swears he will ride with Lan and Managan and Gorenellin join shouting "the Golden Crane flies for Tarmon Gai'don!!"</p>

<h2>Ch 21, Within the Stone, Aes Sedai</h2>
<p><strong>Rand.</strong> Oh yeah, here we go. Rand and his party Travel to Shangtai but the humans are refused, they go to Tear with Cadsuane, Nynaeve, Min, Aliva, and six Maidens including Sarendhra selected by Nandera. They don't try to hide, because they think the Forsaken know where they are. The steamwagon from the Academy of Cairhien by Mervin Poel now travels a hundred miles in a day and can pull many wagons, that's awesome! Rand has his ta'veren effect on the city. There is a new in named The Dragon,  Rand hears a Seanchan accent but cannot catch the man before he leaves. The innkeeper takes them to a room with a view of the Stone. The room is small for the whole party and Rand and Lews Therin get claustrophobia. Rand seizes saidin and Lews Therin lets him hold it. He is dizzy and nauseated. He sees the face of the man from Shadar Logoth furious and also looking sick. He feels like they are almost touching. </p>

<p>Rand weaves Spirit and Fire to form a gateway into the Heart of the Stone. Thinking of Callandor, Rand recalls from the Prophecies that, "Who draws it out shall follow after." He wonders what that means for Narishma but he is otherwise occupied today. There are two Defenders of the Stone standing guard. Iagin Handar offers to take them to Darlin because the corridors have changed. This means the Pattern is loosening and Dark One is touching the world more than since the War of the Shadow. Rand leads the party to Darlin's quarters by the bond to Alanna. He trusts Alanna somewhat because of Min's viewing, but Aes Sedai have their own goals like Nynaeve and Verin. The Stone has gaudy decorations. It held for three thousand years but now with Traveling and Blossoms of Fire it is obsolete.</p>

<p>The Maidens wait outside Darlin's quarters while Rand and the others enter. Darlin, Alanna, Caraline Damodred, Astoril Damara, Weiramon Saniago and Anaiyella Narencelona are there. The women are adopting Min's fashion of coat and breeches. Darlin is still annoyed at Cadsuane for holding Caraline and him captive in Cairhien. Darlin and Caraline are close to engaged. Rand is angry that Weiramon and Anaiyella are there. They were supposed to stay in Cairhien. They brought some armsmen who attacked the rebels and set back negotiations. The rebels hired every mercenary from the Erinin River to the Bay of Remara. Rand shouts at them and Cadsuane spanks him with Air. Darlin tried three times to bring food into the city but the rebels stole it.</p>

<p>Bera Harkin enters with news. Sunamon, Tolmeran and the other High Lords are returning to Tear from Illian against Rand's orders. The good news is an agreement with the rebels, Estanda, Hearne, Tedosian and Simaan. Seanchan were trying to bribe them. Merana and Rafela are preparing the documents. They want their titles back but they will accept Darlin as Steward and as King and swear fealty to him. All Rand's new laws stay. They will pay for feeding the city for a year. Rand is angry at first but Cadsuane reminds him that the agreement meets the requirements he set. Rand agrees. Darlin is incredulous at being named King; Tear has not had a King since Moreina. Min says she knows what his crown should look like. Rand orders Darlin to arrest the Seanchan then to gather an army. Asha'man will take them to Arad Doman to prepare for Tarmon Gai'don. Weiramon and Anaiyella will go with them.</p>

<h2>Ch 22, To Make an Anchor Weep, Sea Folk</h2>
<p><strong>Harine.</strong> Hey, awesome.. well not awesome but... Harine and Shalon arrive in Tear and learn that the meeting of the Wavemistresses is in Illian. Zaida is there and is now the Mistress of the Ships but Harine still believes in Min's viewing that she will eventually win out. Logain shows up and is AWESOME! Also, sadly we now know what the Time of Illusion was... EVERYONE KILLED THEMSELVES! AHHH! </p>

<p>It is early morning. Harine and Shalon and their deckmistress Jadein take a boat to the Seanchan vessel in Illian harbor where the First Twelve of the Atha'an Miere meet. There are so many Sea Folk ships at Illian that most stay out of the harbor lest the Council of Nine and Steward for the Dragon Reborn make trouble for them for blocking trade. A cold wind with a strange odor abruptly blows out of the north and ceases just a quickly. HMMMM! They survived Shadar Logoth and Cadsuane so now they are ready for anything. The boat reaches the Seanchan ship and Harine and Shalon climb a rope ladder to board. They are formally greeted by Turane and Serile, the Sailmistress and Windfinder. Their original vessel sank during the battle at Ebou Dar. </p>

<p>The other Wavemistresses and their Windfinders are already in the great cabin. Lincora, Wallein, Niolle, Lacine, and Pelanna are openly hostile. Only her old friend Mareil is welcoming. Caire is Windfinder to Pelanna and Tebreille is Windfinder to Mareil. All wear brocaded silks and mourning stoles. Caire and Tebreille are still worried over Talaan's apparent kidnapping. Zaida and Shielyn arrive. Zaida brought Amylia, a Brown Ajah Aes Sedai, with her from Caemlyn. She came to study the Sea Folk but she has been beaten into submission and used as a teacher. The man they are awaiting has not yet arrived. He comes from the Coramoor. Zaida plans to send an ambassador back with him.</p>

<p>Turane enters and announces that the man has arrived. He enters and introduces himself as Logain. He Traveled from the docks to the quarterdeck. All the women are shocked, especially Amylia. He asks if she serves Elaida or Egwene but Zaida will not let her answer. She says his is a false Dragon and tainted. Logain says the taint is now gone thanks to the Creator. Zaida demands to know where the Coramoor is but Logain says it is secret; the Forsaken have tried to kill him. But he will accept Harine as ambassador. Harine is shocked and thinks Zaida will divorce her husband Amel before she would let Harine be ambassador again. Logain brings a demand from the Coramoor to send all their ships to Arad Doman with food supplies from Illian and Tear. Bandar Eban is starving.</p>

<p>Turane enters again and runs to Zaida with whispered news. Zaida is horrified. Turane brings in Cemeille din Selaan Long Eyes, Sailmistress of the darter Wind Racer who relates the news. Almost three weeks ago the Amayar on Tremalking began requesting passage to the other islands, even Aile Somera held by the Seanchan. The Great Hand melted and the Amayar took this as a sign the Time of Illusions is ended. The entire race committed mass suicide. The Sea Folk feel responsible as the Amayar requested their protection after the Breaking. Zaida orders the fastest ships to the islands to try to save some but Logain countermands the order. The ships are committed to Bandar Eban. They can mourn on the march for Tarmon Gai'don.</p>

<h2>Ch 23, Call to a Sitting, Forsnaken</h2>
<p><strong>Romanda.</strong> Oh heck yes. This is awesome. A Hall has been called by Lelaine and turns out Narishma is here and tells the Hall of Halima using saidin... SO GOOD! Rand has tasked Narishma to talk to this Hall and say the Aes Sedai can bond 47 Soldier and Dedicated Asha'man. OH YES THIS IS AWESOME. Romanda remembers where she heard of Cabriana Mecandes and announces that they must order the arrest of Delana and Halima immediately. They are already gone, last seen with Delana and her serving woman carrying bundles toward the Traveling ground.</p>

<p>Forty-seven balances the sisters bonded by Asha'man. He explains that Elaida sent them against the Black Tower so Taim ordered them captured and bonded. He then tells them of a fifth, Eben Hopwil who was killed by female Forsaken channeling saidin while linked with Daigian and Beldeine. He died defending his Aes Sedai. Escaralde offers her sympathies.</p>

<p>Romanda is in the tent she shares with Magla and Salita, reading about Birgitte and Gaidal Cain in The Flame, the Blade and the Heart. She grew up in Far Madding. The weaves of Keeping that Egwene discovered are failing. Bodewhin Cauthon straightens the tent for the other two; Aelmara is Romanda's personal servant. She shares her tent in order to keep an eye on the two other Sitters for the Yellow. They follow her lead far too seldom. Magla insisted on Salita as the new Sitter for the Yellow but Romanda does not understand why. She wanted Dagdara but gave in so she would be elected First Weaver, her position before she retired.</p>

<p>Nisao enters, leaving Sarin Hoigan to stand guard outside, and Romanda sends Bodewhin to her classes. Varilin still leads the daily negotiations with Elaida's embassy in Darein with Magla, Saroiya, Takima and Faiselle. Nisao wards against eavesdropping then asks Romanda to intercede with Lelaine. Lelaine ordered her to stop inquiring into the murders of Anaiya and Kairen as she was doing under Egwene's command. Romanda is only now realizing Egwene's strength of leadership. Romanda agrees to intercede. All that Nisao learned so far is that they were both close friends with Cabriana Mecandes.</p>

<p>Theodrin arrives as Nisao leaves. Romanda took her in because the Brown Ajah did not really support her. She announces that Lelaine called a Sitting of the Hall. Romanda heads to the Hall alone as she has no Warder. She sees Gareth Bryne escorting Siuan to the Blue Ajah area of the camp. She hears a gong that signifies change of classes for the novices. Sharina Melloy has reorganized the whole novice structure without even asking Tiana. Ahead she sees Sharina talking to Tiana. As Romanda approaches, Sharina curtsies and leaves. Tiana tells her that Sharina and many others including a Murandian noble are learning Nynaeve's new Healing. Romanda is appalled that novices are allowed to learn Healing, normally reserved for Aes Sedai, but Tiana defends herself. Romanda sees Delana heading the same direction with Halima lecturing her. She thinks they are pillow-friends. Fortunately for Romanda the new style of Healing is different enough so that it is not subject to the second-learned weave limitation. </p>

<p>Romanda arrives at the Hall pavilion where a crowd is already gathered. Sheriam is there. It is embarrassing as the Keeper is only allowed in the Hall if the Amyrlin is present. Delana, Lelaine, Moria and Janya are already there. Malind and Faiselle discuss how they finally coerced Myrelle into bonding Llyw. After Romanda seats herself Kwamesa arrives, then Salita followed by Lyrelle, Saroiya, Aledrin, Samalin, Faiselle, Malind, Escaralde. Varilin is still in Darein but they have more than eleven so they may begin. Aledrin makes them private. At Lelaine's request Moria goes across the street to the Blue Ajah quarters and returns with Merise Haindehl, Jahar Narishma and her other two Warder. The Sitters recognize him as an Asha'man. Malind rushes away. Merise announces that the Dragon Reborn asked Cadsuane to send her. Jahar asks for Egwene and Romanda says she is unavailable.</p>

<p>Jahar is suddenly furious; a man just tried to listen in. Aledrin agrees that something touched her ward. Delana gets up and runs. Malind returns with Nacelle of the Green Ajah. She weaves all five Powers around him, something akin to detecting residues. She excitedly announces that he is holding saidin. On request, he channels Spirit toward Saroiya and Nacelle can detect it. Nacelle then leaves. Jahar announces that any sister faithful to Egwene al'Vere may bond an Asha'man soldier or Dedicated, to a total of forty-seven. Romanda likes the idea but Faiselle and Saroiya are adamantly opposed. Jahar announces that the taint is gone and Merise confirms. All but Faiselle and Saroiya vote to accept the offer so they have the lesser consensus.</p>

<h2>Ch 24, Honey in the Tea, Aes Sedai</h2>
<p><strong>Egwene.</strong> whoa, that was a lot of pages - 40+ in my copy. Let's tldr; Egween gets beaten constantly from Silviana (Miss of Novices), and eventually catches up with Beonin who starts to deny her betrayal of Egwene and chokes, Eg thinks that means she isn't BA but she betrayed the moles. Egwene orders Beonin to warn them, The White Tower are quizing Beonin, Leane, and Egwene to learn the new weaves, but they aren't sharing all the weaves. All the novices stand for Egwene at breakfast and she has... honey in her tea. Egween is winning her war. Beatiful. </p>

<h2>Ch 25, Attending Elaida, Dice</h2>
<p><strong>Tarna.</strong> Hey, I am interested in the whole Pattern losening, that's pretty neat. Literally hallways change?! That's pretty neat.. not like Harry Potter at all... JK. SO!</p> 

<p>It is nine days since Egwene was captured. Tarna climbs the stairs to Elaida's quarters; she avoids the corridors where she might run into sisters of another Ajah. On her way she thinks on Pevara's question from almost two weeks ago. Which Red Ajah sisters can be trusted to bond Asha'man, even with Tsutama's blessing? She has only one name on her list and that one will not work. Elaida and Meidani are in the sitting room; they spend a lot of time together.</p> 

<p>Tarna announces that she has the morning reports and Elaida sends Meidani away. Elaida confides that they were pillow-friends and she might allow it again to question her. That is rare outside of novices and Accepted, though Tarna recalls Galina making a pass at her. Tarna prefers men. Elaida allowed the weave of Keeping to be shared widely and it seems to be working. Tarna has no news on the other nine moles. There is no news on locating the seals. The harbors are blocked so that the city is starting to suffer. Elaida orders penances with Silviana for any Sitters who do not deliver enough workers to dismantle the chains. Tarna reports that Egwene spends half her days with Silviana. Elaida wants her tamed but not broken so the White Tower will be strong. Tarna recalls Galina beating her block out of her. Elaida wants Egwene to attend her tonight.</p>

<p><strong>Mat.</strong> Mat and Tuon sittin' in a tree... haha, this was awesome! So Talmanes is back and so are A LOT OF THE BAND for Mat! Also, Tuon and Mat kissed and she thinks Mat is feverish from his wounds. Mat also sees Cadsuane with Rand and the colors spinning. Mat also thinks the gholam is following Luca's circus now. The Seanchan have camps scattered all over. There was a landslide so the pass Vanin was planning to use is now blocked. The Damona Mountains were made during the Breaking so other passes are unlikely. They set out riding and Mat starts to plan how to get out of Altara. </p>

<p>Mat and his party leave Maderin and head into the forest as soon as they are out of sight of any farms. The dice start up again. Two days later they stop for a midday rest. They are three hundred miles west of Damona Mountains; he wants to reach them in a week. Vanin knows a smugglers' pass. After the pass they are two days from Murandy.</p>

<p>Lopin and Nerim serve lunch to Mat, Tuon, Selucia and Setalle. Afterwards, Mat uses Aludra's strikers to light his pipe. Thom and Aludra play stones. The Redarms including Metwyn and Harnan take care of the sixty pack horses that Luca purchased in Maderin. Mat gave a purse of gold to Petra and Clarine when they left. Leilwin, Domon, Juilin and Amathera are also nearby. Noal plays Snakes and Foxes with Olver. The game reminds Mat of the Eelfinn and maybe the Aelfinn being in his head. Joline, Blaeric and Fen, Bethamin and Seta, Teslyn and Edesina are there. Joline and Edesina are now teaching both Bethamin and Seta.</p>

<p>Mat thinks the gholam is following Luca's circus. Luca is still heading for Murandy as well. Mat refused Healing after Maderin and now his wounds are infected. A blacklance wriggles out from under the log Juilin and Amathera are sitting on. Juilin starts after it, but Mat tells him to let it go. Tuon lets Mat kiss her and he does a thorough job. She then sends Selucia for ointments for his wounds.</p>

<p>Riders approach and Mat mounts Pips. They are Vanin and Talmanes. Talmanes tells Mat that Vanin updated him on Nalesean and the others. Mat is angry that Talmanes is in Altara instead of being with Egwene. Talmanes tells him Egwene really is the Amyrlin and they are off to besiege Tar Valon. They can Travel like the Dragon Reborn. Mat sees the colors spin and resolve into Rand talking with an Aes Sedai with gray hair in a bun. Talmanes brought three banners of horse, four thousand mounted crossbowmen and the masons. He left three banners of horse and five of foot in Murandy with orders to move north into Andor. King Roedran paid them so they have plenty of money. Mat introduces Talmanes Delovinde to Tuon. Mat grabs his hat and ashandarei and orders Talmanes to take them to the Band. The Seanchan have camps scattered all over. There was a landslide so the pass Vanin was planning to use is now blocked. The Damona Mountains were made during the Breaking so other passes are unlikely. They set out riding and Mat starts to plan how to get out of Altara.</p>

<h2>Ch 26, As if the World Were Fog, Wheel and Snake</h2>
<p><strong>Tuon.</strong> Yep, I love this. </p>

<p>As they ride through the forest, Tuon and Selucia keep close to Mat so she can hear his conversation with Talmanes. She failed to catch Mat's lie that he did not know the Dragon Reborn. Mat's was her first kiss. Talmanes left Estean in charge in Murandy; he is the only noble who will listen to Daerid, a commoner. Talmanes brought Edorion, Reimon and Carlomin. They are all Banner-Generals now. Talmanes and Daerid are Lieutenant-Generals. Tuon is intrigued by the Red Hand symbol, Mat's ring, and the fact that he remembers Hawkwing's face. Tuon is bemused by Mat's complexity and capability. Mat is concerned about the crossbowmen riding, but Talmanes says they all ride well. They also have the new crank that lets them fire seven or eight times a minute. A mechanic in Murandy invented it and was taking it to the school in Caemlyn. Talmanes cites Madoc Comadrin in Fog and Steel, "It is always better to kill your enemies far off than close at hand." King Roedran has two copies of the book. Gorderan and the other Redarms keep a watchful eye out. Thom and Aludra ride up near Tuon. She thinks Thom is a spy but does not know who sent him to Ebou Dar. Thom tells her the chance encounter with Talmanes must be because Mat is ta'veren, "tied to the Pattern" in the Old Tongue, like Artur Hawkwing. She thinks that is a myth.</p>

<p>In about an hour they reach the Band. They have not seen any raken but they are still cautious. Most of the Seanchan are to the north or south. Talmanes' scouts have located most of their camps from the Malvide Narrows to their current location. The men sing two verses of Jak o' the Shadows. The Band has its own mapmaker now, Master Roidelle. He made detailed maps of eastern Altara to the Damona Mountains. Soldiers take Akein and Rosebud.</p>

<p>Lopin serves them tea. Nerim is delighted to be back with Talmanes. Leilwin, Domon, Noal, Olver, Juilin, Amathera and Mistress Anan sit nearby. Mat has a reunion with Edorion, Reimon and Carlomin. They bow to Edesina, Joline, Teslyn and even Bethamin and Seta. Master Roidelle brings his maps. Mat studies the one with the Seanchan camps marked and begins planning a war. Tuon now thinks he more a lion than a buffoon.</p> 

<p><strong>Perrin.</strong> MY WIFE! THAT'S ALL THAT MATTERS! Also, the world is *rippling* now?? What?! Also, the crew is entering the aqueduct to get into the cistern and then to the fortress to wait for Faile.. sweet! Also, they now know Galad killed Valda. And there are more bands of Aiel to the southeset and southwest coming - three days out. Faile is all that matters to Perrin. </p>

<p><strong>Faile.</strong> No Faile, I don't approve of the kissing games Rolan wants to play with you. Also, Twenty more gai'shain begged to swear fealty to her just this morning. They want to attack the Aiel. After arguing and slapping each other, Galina says straight out that she will leave tomorrow and take Faile and her friends with her. Faile says the Oath Rod is hidden in town and offers to get it. Galina declines and tells her to take it tomorrow morning to a building marked with a red scarf at the south end of town. Faile believes her. I don't!</p>

<h2>Ch 27, A Plain Wooden Box, Dragon</h2>
<p><strong>Rand.</strong> Holy smokes, Rand has lost a hand?! Okay, I have to say I was spoiled on this one, just not the *how* or *when* really. I blame Daniel Greene lol, he was doing a WOT Cover Ranking Drunk Green Screen Test and he talk about how they did a poor job hiding Rand's nub... lol. But HOLY FREAKING CRAP SEMIRHAGE?!?! AHHHHHH! Good thing Nynaeve was there, I don't know what would've happened?! How long was Semirhage masquarading as Anath Dorje, the Truthspeaker? Also this feels V important because I feel so bad for Rand and the way people look at him after this... but Min still loves and loves him.. also, Rand is having some vision problems... everything seems watery. </p>

<p>Semirhage tells them that Rand is insane, that he has Lews Therin in his head. Lanfear confirmed that he knew things only Lews Therin could. Graendal was an expert in hearing voices from past lives. She was known as the Lady of Pain. Everyone else is stunned at the revelation. Falendre swears they thought Semirhage was Tuon. Cadsuane and Semirhage try to outstare each other. Hamad and Aghan return from the house with a plain wooden box. The residents were killed. The box contains six a'dam and five copies of the sad bracelets. Nynaeve is furious that Egeanin failed to get rid of them. Rand says to send the sul'dam and damane back to Ebou Dar with the message that the Dragon Reborn still wants to meet with the Daughter of the Nine Moons.</p>

<p>Rand is riding Tai'daishar with Min, Alivia, Cadsuane, Nynaeve, Bashere and eighty-one lancers, Nandera and two dozen other Maidens. They are in northern Altara a few miles from the Andoran border. They are a hundred and fifty leagues west of Caemlyn and Elayne so his sense of her is faint. Aviendha is even fainter in Arad Doman. The manor is to the west. He wears the Crown of Swords and carries the Dragon Scepter. Lews Therin calls him a fool for walking into a trap. Alivia revealed that the Daughter of the Nine Moons is actually the heir to the Empress. There are also more than twenty-five Asha'man, Aes Sedai and Warder including Logain, Toveine and Gabrelle, Mezar Kurin and Adrielle, Donalo Sandomere and Ayako, Welyn Kajima and Jenare, Beldeine and Karldin, Elza and Fearil, Merise, Narishma and her other two Warder. Beldeine bonded Karldin with his permission. Rand wonders where Nynaeve sent Lan. Cadsuane and Nynaeve have all their ter'angreal jewelry.</p>

<p>At noon Rand, Logain, Narishma, Donalo Sandomere, Cadsuane, Nynaeve and Min, ride to Lady Deirdru's manor. Narishma and Donalo Sandomere are the strongest of the Asha'man after Logain. Nynaeve and Cadsuane hold saidar but have it masked. The Asha'man are trying to duplicate what Nacelle figured out in reverse - how to detect women's weaves. Farther up the road is the village of King's Crossing where a bridge crosses the narrow Reshalle River.</p>

<p>At the manor house, six sul'dam and six damane come out followed by a short, dark woman. Nynaeve detects that one of them is channeling; Cadsuane can do something about it when they get a little closer. As they approach the small dark woman flickers. Rand and Lews Therin both recognize Semirhage and fight for saidin. While they are fighting, Semirhage throws a fireball at Rand. It destroys the Dragon Scepter and blows off his left hand.</p>

<p>As Rand regains his senses he sees that Semirhage and the Seanchan are captured. Gateways open and the other Asha'man, Aes Sedai, Warder and Maidens arrive with Bashere and his men. One pair of sul'dam and damane are dead. Sandomere and Narishma are injured. Nynaeve and Merise Heal them. Bashere sends Aghan and Hamad to search the house and Matoun to form the lancers for defense. Nynaeve Heals Rand's hand to a stump, the best she can do. There is something wrong with his eyes as well. Rand tells them about Semirhage. Falendre, one of the captured sul'dam, says she is Anath Dorje, the Truthspeaker.</p>

<h2>Cadsuane's Hair Onaments</h2>
<p>So I'm going by memory but we now know that Cadsuane's hair ornaments contain: (1) an an'greal; various ter'angreal that can (2) sense saidin/saidar and point to where it's coming from; (3) act as a  "well" of Saidar;  (4) absorb / unravel weaves used against her. And that's not all of them...</p> 

<p><strong>Mat.</strong> An awesome small takedown of some SC. Mat and the Band are preparing a trap for a nearby force of Seanchan soldiers. Mat's plan is to create havoc among the Seanchan forces in northeast Altara to draw their main army out of the Molvaine Gap so that he and the Band can slip though into Murandy.</p>

<p>Aludra sends up two green nightflowers, a message that the camp raken is heading west for help. Mat will intercept the help. Teslyn is with Mat. He would prefer Bethamin or Seta but they might refuse to help him against the Seanchan. Leilwin refused him outright. Teslyn, Joline and Edesina try to interfere in his plans. Tuon planned to call Joline "Rosi". Setalle always seems to take Tuon's side in arguments.</p>

<p>Londraed spots Aludra's signal. Mat orders Vanin to ride out as lookout. Mandevwin orders Connl to get the crossbowmen in order. Master Roidelle has all the Seanchan forces marked on his maps. The Seanchan avoid the Lugard Road until they reach the Malvide Narrows and the Molvaine Gap beyond. At the road, Mandevwin has Admar, Eyndel, Madwin and Dongal arrange their men half on each side. Talmanes convinced the lancers and nobles to wear dull colors for camouflage. Vanin returns with news that the Seanchan force is approaching. When they reach Mat's position Teslyn channels a ball of light above them and the crossbowmen cut them down using their bolt cranks to reload before the Seanchan can react. Mat quickly has them on the move to rejoin with Carlomin and the rest. They plan to hit the Seanchan again before sunrise.</p>

<h2>Ch 28, In Malden, Blacksmith Puzzle?</h2>
<p><strong>Faile.</strong> Faile, Maighdin, Alliandre, and Lacile are trapped in a basement of the building Galina tied the red scarf to - Faile gave Galina the Oath Rod and Galina ran away. Maighdin (Morgase) is slowly succeeding in channeling to move the scarf! Faile can hear wolves!</p>

<p><strong>Galina.</strong> Galina might.. might get out of Malden and this Shaido encampent free.. but she hears wolves and fog building and knows Perrin has started his attack! </p>

<h2>Ch 29, The Last Knot, Wolf</h2>
<p><strong>Perrin.</strong> Perrin and crew are gearing up for a good plan.. so it seems. </p>

<p>From the ridge top west of Malden Perrin studies the town and the surrounding camp. Neald did a good job with the thick fog. He expects Faile and her companions to be heading to the fortress. He goes back to Dannil Lewin, Jori Congar and Balwer. Balwer reports that Masema is nearby though he and his twenty thousand men are supposed to be beyond the eastern ridge. Haviar and Nerion are with Balwer so Masema will not see them. Perrin sends Basel Gill , Lamgwin, Breane and Lini north with all the carts, servants and provisions. They agree, though they do not want to leave Maighdin. They are to find the Jehannah Road, drop off Alliandre's people in Jehannah, then head east. Perrin will catch up with them when Faile is rescued. Gallenne and Arganda lead their respective forces. Even Tylee thinks Perrin has a good plan.</p>

<p>Sulin arrives and announces that the Shaido sentries to the north are dead. Elienda and Briain were killed and Aviellin needs Healing. A party of people approaches: Annoura, Masuri, Berelain, Masema, Aram and the six Wise Ones including Edarra, Janina, Carelle and Nevarin. The Wise Ones have learned Healing so Janina goes with Sulin to help Aviellin. When Masema mentions the Lord Dragon, Perrin sees an image of Rand, Min and a tall Asha'man. Rand's left hand is gone. Masema left Nengar in charge of his army. He intends to keep an eye on Perrin. A gateway opens and Neald comes through with Gueye Arabah, a lieutenant to Tylee. He reports that the two new bands of Shaido will arrive about noon. The wolves howl so the attack begins.</p>

<p><strong>Faile.</strong> Maighdin was able to catch attention of the gai'shain that were following Faile. Rolan and some Mera'din show up to clear the rubble and Faile intends to tell Rolan aobut Dairaine so he will let her go. </p>

<p><strong>Perrin.</strong> Incredible. Tam is here with a lot more Two Rivers, Deven Ride, Watch Hill, Taren Ferry, and outlanders who settled into the Two Rivers! Tam tells Perrin that Mazrim Taim visited the Two Rivers and took forty men and boys to the Black Tower. He told Tam that Rand is the Dragon Reborn. The prickley bush! Perrin and Aram are on their way to get Faile... no matter what! </p>

<p>There is an alarm, a Shaido raiding party is headed toward them from the camp. Perrin is focused on the city gates. Perrin and Aram walk out of the fog and let themselves be seen. Then the Ghealdanin and Mayener lancers ride out. The Shaido warriors start forward and send out flanking forces. When they are in range, Tam gives the order and the Two Rivers bowmen begin cutting them down. There is some channeling from the Shaido camp, but only a few of the Wise Ones are still able. The sul'dam and damane to the north and south begin taking out the Shaido flankers. Annoura, Masuri and the Wise Ones who have been defending against the Shaido Wise Ones now begin attacking as well. Perrin feels the thrill of battle that he discussed with Elyas. He heads down the slope toward the town gates with Aram, fighting their way through the remaining algai'd'siswai. Nothing will keep him from Faile.</p>

<h2>Ch 30, Outside the Gates, Aiel</h2>
<p><strong>Faile.</strong> Maighdin is a channeler! We knew that, it's just nice to see that she is affected by the forkroot.. well not nice. Anyways, they're saved by Rolan and crew. They see and hear the One Power battle happening and are on their way out of Malden now! Finally. </p>

<p><strong>Perrin.</strong> Perrin has found Faile.. not after ARAM TRIED TO KILL PERRIN?! OH WOW OH WOW! Luckily Aram was killed by some Shaido. So Masema convinced him Perrin was Shadospawn eh? I really was interested in what Perrin could've done with Aram.. sadly not going to happen now. Also, did Perrin kill Rolan?</p>

<p>Turning a corner, he sees a horde of people in white led by three veiled Shaido algai'd'siswai. One, much bigger than Lamgwin, pulls Faile. Perrin leaps at him and kills him with his hammer. Faile and Lacile stab the other two in the back. Faile smells guilty so Perrin thinks she was raped. Seems to me like Perrin killed Rolan.</p> 

<p>Perrin tells them all to head north, the safest direction. He sends Theril to the fortress to tell Ban, Seonid and the others they can come out now. Perrin and Faile share stories on Galina and figure she must be Black Ajah. They all return in a quarter hour. Selande and the other Cha Faile cluster around Faile. Rovair Kirklin goes to find Masuri. Tallanvor cradles Maighdin. Gaul goes to find Chiad and Elyas accompanies him. Furen and Teryl are with Seonid. She Heals Perrin, then Faile. She hears Faile mention Galina. After hearing the story, Seonid claims the right to try her in the White Tower. </p>

<p>The battle is now over. Tylee rides up. She has Sevanna naked and tied across her horse. Most of Masema's men on the east ridge are dead. The sul'dam already collared over two hundred Shaido Wise Ones. Masema escaped with a hundred of his men. Perrin's forces had only light casualties. Faile claims Sevanna's wealth to help restore the hundred thousand prisoners the Shaido took. Perrin introduces Faile and Alliandre to Tylee and reminds her that Ghealdan is under his protection. They need to get going before the other two Shaido septs arrive. Perrin thought he was making a deal with the Dark One but now he thinks of Tylee as a friend.</p>

<p><strong>Galina.</strong> Welp, I am struggling to care for Galina and Galina's story lol. So Therava finds Galina and takes the Oath Rod back. There are Wise Ones including Belinde and Modarra there and several hundred Shaido - they are goin to regroup and return to the Three-fold Land, never to leave again. They will rebuild even though it will take generations. Galina is broken and she will be Therava's little Lina for the rest of her life. And so continues the Shaido plot.</p> 

<h2>Ch 31, The House on Full Moon Street, Darkfriends</h2>
<p><strong>Elayne.</strong> Elayne you're so silly. Couple things.. Elayne felt Rand's hand being blown off, and he has been Traveling everyday. Melfane is now Elayne's midwife. Antoher Kinswoman has been murdered, the third in ten days and seven before that. Sumeko is the Eldest with Reanne gone but Alise argues there is no longer a Knitting Circle. I don't trust this Hark fellow.Elaida sent Duhara to be Elayne's advisor. Hark tells them Mellar goes to The House of Full Moon Street with Lady Shiane, and Marilin (cat BA) and Falion. They go, For some reason Elayne goes... stupid. Elayne busts in with Sareitha, Vandene, and Careane and weaves Spirit to hide their channeling. They shield the two BA and bind them with Air. Then Asne, Temaile, Chesmal, and Eldrith come in and shield them all. Asne has a bent black rod that can kill or stun at a hundred paces - Shiaine asks if Moridin sent them. Turns out Careane was Black and killed Adeleas and Vandene gets her revenge!!!! WOOOOO! </p>

<p>Vandene stabs Careane, a gift from Adeleas. Chesmal weaves Fire, Earth and Water and Sareitha and Vandene collapse, dead. Chesmal says the Warder will be coming now and Elayne hopes that Birgitte will run.</p>

<h2>Ch 32, To Keep the Bargain, Sea Folk</h2>
<p><strong>Birgitte.</strong> I knew I liked Birgitte, and the Sea Folk. BOOM. DANG. Awesome. A lot of names happened here, but what's most important.. Elayne was saved by Chanelle (Windfinder) and her circle of eight Windfinders, thanks to Birgitte and a whole host of cavalry, including Captain Guybon! The balefire-firehose was used and Guybon didn't waiver at all to save Elayne... BOOOOM!</p> 

<h2>Ch 33, Nine Out of Ten, Lion</h2>
<p><strong>Elayne.</strong> "Elayne and Andor"! That's all. Wonderful, wonderful. I'm happy we're here. Also, I love that Birgitte thinks they will need Mat's luck. </p>

...

<p>As Guybon leads his force to attack from behind, the gates open and Dyelin's force attacks from the front. She sees Conail, Branlet and Perival ride out from the gate. Dyelin holds back Catalyn. After a bloody battle Arymilla's army surrenders at midmorning. The lesser nobles are escorted into the city to be held for ransom.</p>

<p>The Guardsmen bring Arymilla, Naean and Elenia before Elayne. Already deep in debt, their ransoms will ruin them. Arymilla threatens her with Jarid, but Elenia says he will just preserve House Sarand. Lir Baryn, Karind Anshar and Sylvase Caeren appear next. Sylvase announces that Nasin is dead, she is now High Seat and she stands for Trakand. She offers her new secretary, Jaq Lounalt, to help convince the others but Elayne declines. Lir and Karind also announce for Trakand. Elayne now has nine of the ten Houses she needs</p>

<h2>Ch 34, A Cup of Kaf, Seanchan</h2>
<p><strong>Furyk.</strong> Golly, I believe Mat is in for a big fight with these SC. Furyk has been searching for Tuon for nearly four weeks and is not at a camp in north-central Altara. </p>

<p>Many Seanchan troops believe the rumor that Deathwatch Guards have a fake High Lady so they do not cooperate. The Deathwatch Guards are da'covale to the Empress herself. Ajimbura killed one soldier who insulted Karede. Karede left him in the forest with the sul'dam and damane. He has eighty men and twenty-one Ogier with him. Most of the raken were sent west for some reason. (PERRIN! right??) </p>

<p>Karede leaves Captain Musenge and Hartha in charge of the men and enters the command tent. When Ogier fight they are as cold as deep winter in Jeranem. The officers in the tent are from many parts of Seanchan, Khoweal, Dalenshar, N'Kon, Mechoacan, or Alqam. Banner-General Gamel Loune sends out the rest of the officers. His manservant Mantual, from Pujili, enters and serves kaf, a fine Ijaz Mountains brew.</p>

<p>After he leaves, Gamel Loune reluctantly tells Karede the situation. His forces have been constantly harassed the last week by an unknown army. Men are torn apart by explosions. They must have Asha'man or Aes Sedai, yet the damane say they were not caused by the One Power. Gurat fell into a trap and lost several banners of men. Whoever leads the opposition is very, very good. Karede wonders if Thom Merrilin is actually Agelmar Jagad or Gareth Bryne.[3] He plans to make the best use of Suroth's involvement. General Chisen is bringing his entire army from the Malvide Narrows to help. Karede thanks him for his time and for the kaf and leaves. Karede tells Musenge and Hartha that they will head northeast for the Malvide Narrows, four days away.</p>

<h2>Ch 35, The Importance of Dyelin, Lion</h2>
<p><strong>Elayne.</strong> I have always been suspicious of Dyelin. But I shouldn't be. Elayne does good here. </p>

...

<p>Elayne asks if Dyelin wants to be Queen and she says no. Elayne is the better ruler, partly because of her connection to Rand. Mistress Harfor and Master Norry make their usual reports. There are still arsons every night. Elayne signs death warrants for the turncoat mercenaries, Rhys a'Balaman and Aldred Gomaisen. Evard Cordwyn died in the battle. She denies a reward for Hafeen Bakuvun as he was just doing his job. The prisoners are not talking.Mellar only swears. Deni's Guardswomen beat him severely. Elayne had the Great Serpent rings melted even though that was Egwene's prerogative. Elayne orders Norry to request the loan of Lady Sylvase' secretary.</p>

<p>Mistress Harfor announces the arrival of the nobles. Caseille leads the Guardswomen who escort her to the Grand Hall. It is decorated with images of the women who built a strong nation out the rubble of Artur Hawkwing's empire. Dyelin is already there talking with Sylvase, Conail, Catalyn, Branlet and Perival. Lir and Karind are nearby. Mistress Harfor escorts in Luan, Arathelle, Pelivar, Aemlyn, Ellorien and Abelle. Wine and Tremalking black tea are served. Luan says they have come to ask for a truce. Dyelin says she published support of House Taravin for Elayne. This ruins the other nobles' plans for her to be Queen.</p>

<p>Luan says they still need a truce to deal with the Borderlanders. Elayne explains how she dealt with them; they should be on their peaceful way to Murandy now. Ellorien is furious but cannot come up with a better way to deal with them. Abelle asks what her plan is for the Black Tower. She says she has no plan. She is no more able to act against them than the White Tower. Abelle and Luan say they now stand for Trakand. After some thinking, Arathelle, Pelivar and Aemlyn do as well. Elayne knows they are actually doing it for Dyelin. Ellorien leaves in a huff saying she needs to get back to Sheldyn. Elayne now has the throne but half her support is suspect and tenuous. She wonders how long it will be before Andor must ride to the Last Battle.</p>

<h2>Ch 36, Under an Oak, Harp</h2>
<p><strong>Furyk.</strong> Good heavens, I have tears welling up in my eyes right now. If only I could skip across the office.... this is amazing, oh I love it so much "bloody Matrim Cauthon is my husband".... tears! </p>

<p>This is freaking awesome! WOW! Furyk and a crew come to talk with Thom and turns out... Tuon is there. There are things I love about the Seanchan and there are things I hate about the Seanchan. I love, the way Furyk thinks "the way she is speaking, she is under the veil still", like what?! THAT IS SO COOL. AHH! Mat is awesome, this is awesome. I couldn't breathe this entire interaction. I thought there was about to be an incredible battle. WOW! I LOVED IT! Tuon and Mat are married now, according to the SC. Wow. Beautiful.</p>

<p><strong>Mat.</strong> Mat is such an honorable man. WOW. Mat is shocked to his boots. The dice stopped. He asks her why, she does not act like she is in love with him. Tuon is surprised. The Blood marry for politics, not love. She asks how he knew she would complete the ceremony. He briefly tells her about the Aelfinn and Eelfinn and the twisted red doorway. She does not believe him but Edesina confirms it.</p>

<p>Let's do this from Tuon's perspective... Lidya (damane) Fortelling: Beware the fox that makes the ravens fly, for he will marry you and carry you away. Beware the man who remembers Hawkwing's face, for he will marry you and set you free. Beware the man of the red hand, for him you will marry and none other. His ring shows a fox startling two ravens and nine crescent moons. He remembers Hawkwing's face. He leads the Band of the Red Hand. He carried her away.</p>

<p>Freeing her to go back to Ebou Dar was the last part. Vanin rides up with news that there are ten thousand soldiers nearby. There is a hundred thousand crown reward for killing Tuon. Mat tells Karede to go on, but leave some Deathwatch Guards and Gardeners so the soldiers will think Tuon is still with him.</p>

<p><strong>Tuon.</strong> Higness... ugh I love this so much. Tuon and Selucia pack lightly. Tuon takes the silk rosebud cluster. She only says goodbye to Mistress Anan. She thinks she might come to love Mat. The Empress supposedly loved her father. Back in the Deathwatch Guard camp, she announces that she has removed the veil. She is once again the Daughter of the Nine Moons. Karede proudly says that if they die, they will die as who they are.</p>

<h2>Ch 37, Prince of the Ravens, Dice</h2>
<p><strong>Mat.</strong> Okay, yes Joline is pretty cool.. "yes I feel in danger now" haha. A cool battle scene to end this off.. oh wait! AN EPILOGUE! Couple things....</p>

<p>Hartha, Ogier Gardener returned with a head that Musenge recognizes but won't say more, they must take this to Tuon as fast as possible. Also, Macoll carries the Red Hand Banner that says "it's time to toss the dice" in the OT... heck yes. And now.... Mat is, since marrying Tuon, the Prince of the Ravens! YES YES YES!</p>

<h2>Epilogue, Remember the Old Saying, Wheel and Snake</h2>
<p><strong>Suroth.</strong> Satisfying! Suroth is in the military headquarters room of the Tarasin Palace with Captain-General Galgan. As Semirhage promised, a ship arrived with news of the death of the Empress and rebellion in the Empire.</p>

<p>Tuon enters accompanied by the Deathwatch Guard and Gardeners. She has heard of the death of the Empress. She commands Karede to show everyone what Captain Musenge brought her, the head of Elbar. Tuon meets eyes with Galgan, Abaldar Yulan, Yamada, all of the Blood except Suroth. She announces that Suroth Sabelle Meldarath is no more. The Deathwatch Guard may have the da'covale until her hair has grown enough for her to be sold. Suroth wails as they cut off her clothing.</p>

<p><strong>Pevara.</strong> HOW DOES TAIM KNOW “let the lord of chaos rule”?!?!? HOW?! And Taim agrees to the Reds bonding Asha’man. I can’t really focus on anything but Taim saying that.. and the other Asha’man that Taim “like” laugh too. AHHHHH!</p>

<p>Pevara Tazanovni, Javindhra Doraille, Desala Nevanche, Tarna Feir, Jezrail and Melare Travel from the Ogier grove in Tar Valon to the Black Tower. Pevara learned the Warder bond weave from Yukiri. Tsutama ordered Javindhra to come because Pevara and Tarna could not select enough Reds themselves.</p>

<p>Pevara asks to see the M'Hael. The Dedicated opens a gateway and steps through. A half hour later, he returns through a larger gateway that leads past a white stone platform with a black stone on top to a palace decorated in red and black with a sigil of a gauntlet holding lightning bolts. A Tairen full Asha'man leads them to the throne room where a hundred mean-looking Asha'man stand around Taim. He curtly asks what they want. Pevara says they want to bond men who can channel as Warder. After all, they bonded fifty-one sisters. Mishraile starts to mouth off but Taim knocks him across the room with Air. Melare offers to Heal him but Taim refuses. As a lesson he will be Healed at the end of the day if he still lives. Taim quickly agrees to their request, surprising the sisters. He says to remember the old saying, "Let the lord of chaos rule," and the Asha'man laugh.</p>
