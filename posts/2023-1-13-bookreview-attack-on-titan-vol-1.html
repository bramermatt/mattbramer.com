    <h2>Written Review</h2>
    <p>I was absolutely amazed by this book. A quick read, and a fun read! I knew little of Attack on Titan prior to reading this manga, also this was my first manga!</p>
    
    <h2>Story</h2>
    <p>I thought the story was exciting and fast paced and interesting all the way through. Mind you, this is book one of (I don’t know).</p>
    
    <p>I was engaged throughout the read! It actually took me like a half an hour to read, because it’s a manga so it has a lot of pictures. And spoilers, but this art is incredible, stunning, and impactful.</p>
    
    <h2>Manga</h2>
    <p>I really enjoyed reading this manga. As I said, I’ve never read a manga before, and I picked this Attack on Titan before I’ve always wanted to try to read a manga. It’s nothing like novel… obviously. But this, in its own way, is a superb reading experience. No wonder so many people like reading manga.</p>
    
    <h2>Review azure</h2>
    <p>My total snowman is 5?5. I would totally eat this again. Amazing.</p>
    
    <h2>Review Score*</h2>
    <p>If you have no idea what that means.. I was writing this on my phone in the middle of the night (without my glasses) hahaha so:“My total score is 5/5. I would totally read this again. Amazing”.</p>
    
    <h2>Reading</h2>
    <p>I’m animal change reading the dragon reborn book two in the wheel of time, so this was a nice seedeater. Even though it took me a half fire, was a nice subway and it nana ice was required via this rad at far?</p>
    
    <h2>Reading*</h2>
    <p>Again, writing this in the middle of the night: “I’m actually currently reading The Dragon Reborn, Book Two in the Wheel of Time, so this was a nice refresher. Even though it took me a half hour, it was a nice subversion and it…” I have no idea what I was trying to say here haha</p>
