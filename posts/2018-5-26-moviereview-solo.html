                <p>Meh, An Overwhelming Meh</p>
                
                <p>Really just nothing special. I guess it’s just that I don’t really care about Han Solo buy this story was just boring or not good enough. It wasn’t anything special and I definitely don’t think you need to see this movie. Not very exciting. I didn’t particularly care about the characters. And this may be might fault and not the movie’s fault but the Kira character; all I could see was Daenarys Targaryen from Game of Thrones. Again, not the movie’s fault but still. This movie was not needed and just didn’t appeal to me. And I’m pretty sure the “coaxium” was never once spoken of in all of Star Wars. The only two “wow” moments were the introduction of Chewbacca and the origin of Han “Solo”. The actor to play Han Solo as well, wasn’t too believable as Han. He was just odd. Now, I am no casting director but I just didn’t like him as Han. I just can’t get over how boring and uninteresting this movie was. Now, I could be wrong and I could have a different opinion than you. But these are my thoughts. Also, this movie was so incredibly predictable. And I really didn’t particularly care about the twists near the end of the movie. Nothing too interesting. I’m not invested in what’s happening and I didn’t particularly feel like this was a good Star Wars movie. Nothing too special here.</p>
                
                <p>I’m very glad for the Regal Crown Club. I have been using these rewards for sometime now, and being able to have a FREE MOVIE with my rewards! So, with SOLO being a new release I just had to pay $1.50 for seeing this. Now I’m so glad I only had to pay $1.50 for this movie.</p>
                
                <p>This movie is completely skippable.</p>
                
                <h2>Spoilers ahead..</h2>
                <p>Beware!</p>

                <p>Okay, what is this about Darth Maul? I’m supposed to believe that he’s alive? I’m supposed to believe that, from episode one when Qui-Gon split him in half and killed him, that he’d somehow be alive and apparently has the same robotics in him like Darth Vader that he’s still alive? Ridiculous. And also, why hasn’t he been in anything since episode one?</p>
                
                <p>AND, this is supposed to start the rebellion? All so confusing. When was this movie supposed to take place?</p>

                <p>I’m just confused and bored from this supposed Star Wars movie. You don’t have to see this movie at all. </p>
