                <h1>New Spring Book Review</h1>
                
                
                <p>I'm going to read this prior to reading A Memory of Light, this is only 300 pages or so - I think I can manage that without too much time before A Memory of Light.</p>
                
                <!-- Post goes here -->
                <div class="blog">

                    <h2>Written Review</h2>
                    <p>I will say, this had some beautiful parts. A short story, compared to other WOT books, but a good story. Action, intrigue, espionoge, and Wheel of Time; what more could you ask for?</p>
                
                    <p>This was the story of how Lan and Moiraine met. Simple as that. White Tower politics included! If you've read this book, New Spring, in release order - after book 10, you would know every single character in this book - and really their futures. I read this book after book 13, right before the final book in the series. I think that is a GREAT PLACE to read it! You're brought back to characters you know and love and get to see how they met.. what more could you ask for really?</p>
                
                    <p>I felt this book deserved more. It was short, and things happened, but they could've been expanded! There were slow parts, and there were fast parts, but there is a saying "this was greater than the sum of its parts". I'd say this applies. The good outway the bad. </p>
                
                    <p>This was an intriguing story, that is compact and exciting and brings you back into the world of the Wheel of Time from the beginning of the series. We are riding on horses, and we are learning how to use the One Power, plain and simple. </p>
                
                    <p>I enjoyed this book. </p>

                        <summary>Review Score</summary>
                        <p>I am sad to say, this book for my enjoyment, receives a 3/5 score from me. I wanted more out of this story. It was good, don't get me wrong, but I would've enjoyed it so much more if it had more to it.</p>
                
                        <p>Pacing was good, the story was intriguing. Things happened that we'd heard about before (being that this was a Prequel), and that was good. But that also might've been why this book was intriguing. We knew some of the things that happened in this book, but when did they happen, how did they happen, where did they happen - that was answered in this book.</p>
                
                        <p>The ending left me wanting so much more!</p>

                    <summary>Spoiler Story Breakdown</summary>
                
                    <p>This story takes place 20 years before The Eye of the World. It is the final days of the Aiel War. Moiraine Damodred and Siuan Sanche are Accepted in the White Tower and Lan Mandragoran as the uncrowned king of the fallen nation of Malkier is battling in the Aiel War.</p>
                
                    <p>In this 318 page Prequel to the Wheel of Time, we hear about King Laman's death from the Aiel after they've burned most of Cairhrien. We see Moiraine and Siuan get raised to Aes Sedai and both choose the Blue Ajah, not before being in the presence of Tamra Ospenya (the current Amyrlin Seat) and her Keepr of the Chronicles, Gitara Moroso. Gitara has a Foretelling of the Dragon Reborn being born on the slopes of Dragonmount, after she speaks she dies. Moiraine and Siuan are sworn to secrecy and are tasked with finding the Dragon Reborn.</p>
                
                    <p>In the next four months, Moiraine flees the Tower trying to find mother's whove given birth in the timeframe that was spoken by Gitara, of boys that were born on Dragonmount. Siuan becomes apart of the Blue Ajah eyes-and-ears. Prior to Moiraine leaving the Tower, Tamra (Amyrlin), and all of her searchers for the Dragon Reborn are dead!</p>
                
                    <p>Lan and Moiraine meet on the road to Kandor's Aesdaishar Palace. Eventually at the Palace Lan meets with his first lover, Lady Edeyn Arrel, a woman 15 years his senior. Malkier has some very strange customs and Lady Edeyn plans to marry Lan to her daughter, who is 15 years old. </p>
                
                    <p>Eventually Moiraine is found out as Aes Sedai in the Aesdaishar Palace, by another Aes Sedai who was the Mistress of Novices, Merean. Turns out, Ryne, someone who was traveling with Lan was a Darkfriend, and Merean was a Black Ajah. </p>
                
                    <p>Moiraine and Lan join forces against this foe, incurring terrible loss before killing Merean. Moiraine convinces Lan to give up his hopeless war against the Blight and to join her in protecting the Dragon Reborn from the Black Ajah. It is the same war against the Dark One, but a war they have a chance of winning. Lan agrees to become Moiraineâ€™s Warder, and together they begin their quest.</p>
                
                    <p>Also, Moiraine and Siuan pillow friends, or more?? You decide! </p>

                    <details id="notes">
                        <summary>Notes as I Read</summary>
                
                <h2>Ch 1,The Hook, Helmet</h2>
                <p><strong>Lan.</strong> Did we just witness, from Lan's perspective, the killing of King Laman?? THAT IS SO COOL! Also, love this intoroduction to Lan. I will say.. a little slow start to this book hahaha.</p>
                
                <p>It's the fourth day, after three days of battle between the Great Coalition and the Aiel. Lan's camp is around 300. He has fought the Aiel, his sword is wrought with the One Power, this was the sword of Malkier kings. Basram, and Jaim are sentries. Bukama has been following Lan.. he was one of only five who made it out of Malkier when it fell - 20 men left and took baby Lan. Bukama is the last alive. Bukama and Lan still wear the hadori.</p>
                
                <p>After crossing the Spine, the Aiel ravaged Cairhien.. YES KING LAMAN DEAD! Then went through Tear and Andor before reaching Tar Valon. The Great Coalition army is around 200,000 strong. </p>
                
                <p>What I find most important here is Lan is riding a horse, Cat Dancer.. Lan then sees Aiel, over 2,000. Then hears trumpets in the distance, Lan prepares to attack and die but the Aiel don't attack them. They shout "One Man Alone" in the OT, and continue to the Waste. Lan wants to know what Emares knows about what happened here.</p>
                
                <h2>Ch 2, A Wish Fulfilled, Wheel</h2>
                <p><strong>Moiraine.</strong> See I love this, I'm really glad I get to see Moiraine and Siuan in the Tower! Tamra Ospenya is the Amyrlin, Gitara Moroso is the Keeper. Also, ahhhh, Moiraine's uncle is King Laman in Cairhien.. was.</p>
                
                <p>Siuan and Moiraine are ORPHANS! WOW! Moiraine and Siuane replace Temaile and Brendas with Tamra and Gitara.  Moiraine is keenly interested in the battle around Tar Valon because her uncle started the war. High Captain of the Tower Guard Azil Mareed makes regular reports but they are not shared with Accepted. This is the largest battle since Artur Hawkwing's time. Tamra and Gitara were both Blue Ajah. Gitara has had the Foretelling before. Moiraine wonders if that is why Tar Valon was already surrounded by the army when the Aiel arrived and hopes that she might hear one.</p>
                
                <p>Moiraine doesn't like Elaida, hey me either. They then hear trumpets sounding. No news yet. Then BOOM Gitara has a Fortelling: "He is born again! I feel him! The Dragon takes his first breath on the slope of Dragonmount! He is coming! He is coming! Light help us! Light help the world! He lies in the snow and cries like the thunder! He burns like the sun!" YES! The Dragon has been Reborn! Gitara dies. </p>
                
                <p>Siuan and Moiraine are sworn to secrecy.. told to lie if necessary to keep this Fortelling a secret. </p>
                
                <h2>Ch 3, Practice, Fish</h2>
                <p><strong>Moiraine.</strong> We are moving right along here, The Accepted in the Tower are being sent out to find the names, and sex, of any baby born recently.. they're looking for the Dragon Reborn's name and mother's name! Also, Alanna, Myrelle, Zemaille, Verin, and more Accepted are there! Moiraine and Siuan practice for their Testing. Myrelle shows up to help break Moiraine's concentration. Oh, I'm really enjoying this so far. Also, a lot here in these chapters lol.</p>
                
                <p>Even though Moiraine is noble born and Siuan is a fisherman's daughter, Siuan is the natural leader of the two. She intends to have adventures and see the world, maybe Shara and the lands beyond the Aryth Ocean. They both know that Gitara's Foretelling means the Prophecies of the Dragon are coming true. The Dragon Reborn will again face the Dark One at Tarmon Gai'don and again break the world.</p>
                
                <p>They reach Siuan's room in the Accepted quarters. The two wells of Accepted quarters have room for over two hundred, but there are barely more than sixty. The two wells of novice quarters have room for four hundred but now house under a hundred. Fewer than twenty of them will test for Accepted. The White Tower has rooms to house three thousand Aes Sedai, but only four hundred and twenty-three are in residence with twice that number out in the world. - I'm always amazed at the number of Aes Sedai in the Tower.</p>
                
                <p>Siuan channels to light a fire even though it is against the rules. Moiraine feels a tingle. Novices who study together sometimes experience it but with most women it soon goes away. - why does Moiraine feel Siuan?? I DON'T KNOW!</p>
                
                <p>Tamra arrives and announces that she will offer a hundred gold crowns to any woman who recently gave birth. She is sending the Accepted out to conduct a census. Moiraine and Siuan are excited that they will aid in the search for the Dragon Reborn.</p>
                
                <h2>Ch 4, Leaving the Tower, Flame</h2>
                <p><strong>Moiraine.</strong> Toot toot, Moiraine doesn't have Aldeib yet! Moiraine and the Accepted scramble back to their rooms to prepare to leave the White Tower on Tamra's orders.</p>
                
                <p>Besides Moiraine and Siuan, there are Meidani, Brendas, Katerine Alruddin, Carlinya, Alanna, Pritalle, Edesina, Temaile, Desandre, Coladara and Atuan. They all head to the West Stable where grooms and Tower Guards have saddled horses waiting. Moiraine was sent to Merean for jumping her horse, Arrow, over fences. - also, these Aes Sedai, so good having read the other books!</p>
                
                <p>Moiraine's party is led by Bannerman Steler. Oh and Tar Valon is BEAUTIFUL! Love these descriptions.. Ogier built. - also, I was hoping this Ogier was Loial!</p>
                
                <p>They leave the White Tower through the Sunset Gate and head southwest to the Alindaer Gate, the most southerly of the three western gates of Tar Valon. Tar Valon is a melting pot of ethnicities. Much of the city was Ogier built. They pass an inn called The Blue Cat and the Great Fish Market. Outside of Tar Valon they pass through the village of Alindaer and head south. Siuan is disappointed that they do not head more west toward Dragonmount. At the first camp two miles downriver Sarene is already collecting names. They ride to the next camp another mile south and begin collecting names.</p>
                
                <h2>Ch 5, The Human Heart, Wheel</h2>
                <p><strong>Moiraine.</strong> Moiraine and Siuan are gathering names.. Meilyn, her Warder, and Elaida come and tell them they need to be back before dark. Also, I love that Siuan isn't good on a horse. Also Moiraine warding her dreams.. wink.</p>
                
                <p>The Accepted return to their rooms hoping for a bath and a hot meal, but Katerine is waiting with a summons for Moiraine from Merean, the Mistress of Novices. Merean tells Moiraine that King Laman and both his brothers, Moressin and Aldecain, were killed yesterday. Merean seems to expect Moiraine to grieve for her uncles, but they were cruel, ambitious men who held her father in contempt. Merean tells Moiraine that she is to stay in the White Tower tomorrow instead of going out with the other Accepted, but Moiraine begs to be allowed to go.</p>
                
                <p>Back in her room, she shields her dreams and tries to sleep but has nightmares of the Dragon Reborn. She goes to Siuan's room and finds her also awake. They discuss what the White Tower could do when they find him. Verin taught them that most mistakes made by rulers happen because they do not know history. She also taught that women cannot teach men to channel or vice versa. Neither of them sleeps that night.</p>
                
                <h2>Ch 6, Surprises, Rising Sun</h2>
                <p><strong>Moiraine.</strong> Bili Mandair.. could he be the Dragon Reborn?! </p>
                
                <p>Also, Sitters of the Hall are asking Moiraine if she'd want to be Queen of Cairhien. However, Moiraine just wants to leave the Tower now, as soon as she tests for the shawl of course.</p>
                
                <p>Before they leave their quarters Merean arrives and tells Moiraine that she is to remain behind because of her uncles' deaths. She argued with Tamra about sending sisters out instead of Accepted. Moiraine's job will be to recopy the lists of names. To Siuan's dismay, Merean assigns her to keep Moiraine company. After Merean leaves, Moiraine tells Siuan about her uncles. Siuan replies that she has six uncles who were good men, one died saving others, and two who were scoundrels.</p>
                
                <p>When Moiraine finds from Ellid's notes that Willa Mandair gave birth to Bili Mandair the day of the Foretelling in Lord Ellisar's camp west of the river, she writes this down on a separate page. She and Siuan continue to compile a short list of the most promising candidates.</p>
                
                <p>Midmorning Jarna Malari, a Sitter for the Gray, summons Moiraine for a walk. She asks Moiraine's opinion on the Sun Throne. Most of House Damodred is of dark character. Moiraine's half-brother Taringail is already married to the Queen of Andor. Moiraine comments that her older sisters, Anvaere and Innloine, would not be suitable. Six other Sitters, one from each Ajah including Tsutama Rath of the Red, come by later with the same discussion. Moiraine knows exactly what they want, her as Queen of Cairhien. She thinks the only way out is to test for the shawl as soon as possible, then flee.</p>
                
                <h2>Ch 7, The Itch, Wheel</h2>
                <p><strong>Moiraine.</strong> Oh wow, ELYAS! AND KERENE AND STEPIN! Tamra is sending messages to Aes Sedai to meet her. Moiraine thinks they're choosing searchers for the Dragon Reborn! </p>
                
                <p>She gives Moiraine a note for Kerene Nagashi. The Green Ajah quarters have swords painted on the doors. There are lots of Warder around. Rina Hafden watches as Waylin and Elyas practice swords. In another room, Jala Bandevin teaches a new Warder to dance. Kerene is in her rooms with her Warder, Karile and Stepin. After reading the note, she heads immediately to the Amyrlin's quarters muttering that the note did not say why.</p>
                
                <p>As Moiraine returns, she runs into Siuan. She delivered a similar note to Aisha Raveneos of the Gray Ajah. Moiraine figures out that Tamra is choosing them as searchers for the Dragon Reborn. Ellid gave Siuan a blacksmith's puzzle last week. The next day Tamra sends messages to Meilyn Arganya, Valera Gorovni of the Brown Ajah and Ludice Daneen of the Yellow Ajah. All five have a reputation of strict adherence to the law. Aeldra Najaf is raised to Keeper of the Chronicles to replace Gitara. Verin gives Moiraine an herb concoction to help her sleep at night.</p>
                
                <h2>Ch 8, Shreds of Serenity, Fish</h2>
                <p><strong>Moiraine.</strong> Oh dang! Moiraine is going to get TESTED!! Also, the timeframe for the Dragon Rebron's birth has been set..!</p>
                
                <p>SO, Gitara had more Fortellings - LB will come during the lifetimes of sisters now breathing. ... also, Elaida was helping Siuan and Moiraine practice for the Testing. And I think she was... yes she was beating them with the Power and such, but it was teaching them not to get distracted! Apparenlty Elaida was trying to help them cheat the Test? I don't know about that.</p>
                
                <p>Ten days, one week, after Gitara's Foretelling there is a sudden thaw and most of the snow on Dragonmount melts. The timeframe for the Dragon Reborn's birth has been set. Nine days later before dawn Merean summons Moiraine Damodred to be tested for the shawl.</p>
                
                <h2>Ch 9, It Begins, Star</h2>
                <p><strong>Moiraine.</strong> Oh yes, Moiraine is a beast! What is this extra channeling that Anaiya lays on the back of her head? Moiraine enters her Testing..</p>
                
                <p>There is one Aes Sedai from each Ajah present, Elaida for the Red and Anaiya for the Blue. Merean instructs her to look for a six-pointed star to mark the place of each of the hundred weaves. Anaiya channels at the back of her head. At each step she knows that she must remain serene and not make a mistake, but she does not remember how she got here or why. In the world of the test things seem to change at random. Some of the required weaves are as intricate as the finest Mardina lace. At each stage something happens to distract, attack, annoy or embarrass her and she must deal with them while completing the weave. She faces ruffians, thorn vines, spiders and Trollocs. The test continues.</p>
                
                <h2>Ch 10, It Finishes, Rats</h2>
                <p><strong>Moiraine.</strong> Moiraine passed her Test! So Elaida did want Moiraine to fail lol. Stinker. Verin is there and helps Moiraine with her clothes, Anaiya Heals her. Memories come back to Moiraine. Siuan was also taken to her Testing.. she passed too.</p>
                
                <p>Also, Siuan and Moiraine are going to put mice in Elaida's bed lol. </p>
                
                <h2>Ch 11, Just Before Dawn, Flame</h2>
                <p><strong>Moiraine.</strong> This book seems like it is just FLYING BY. I want MORE! Give me more RJ! Woo, Moiraine and Siuan have chosen... BLUE AJAH! Leane is there to help too!</p>
                
                <p>The Three Oaths: "I vow that I will speak no word that is not true." "I vow that I will make no weapon for one man to kill another." "I vow that I will never use the One Power as a weapon except against Shadowspawn, or in the last extreme of defending my life or that of my Warder or of another sister." and boom AGELESS FACE! </p>
                
                <p>Eadyth charges Leane and Rafela to escort Moiraine and Siuan to tour the White Tower as Aes Sedai and enter the Blue Ajah quarters. Ancient custom was to parade through the White Tower clad only in the shawl, but Leane quickly forgoes the tradition. Leane was Accepted with them for a time. Rafela was raised the year before Leane, but strangely she defers to Leane.</p>
                
                <p>Leane reminds Rafela how Verin embarrassed her on her walk, telling her she had a sweet voice for singing. Leane reveals the secret title of the head of the Blue Ajah, the First Selector. Rafela regales them with a list of arcane Blue Ajah customs, including that they should refrain from marrying. Blue is the second smallest Ajah after White. They enter the Blue Ajah quarters to find the hall lined with every Blue sister in Tar Valon, all but Aeldra wearing their shawl.</p>
                
                <h2>Ch 12, Entering Home, Fish</h2>
                <p><strong>Moiraine.</strong> TOWER POLICIES.. MORE PLEASE?! </p>
                
                <p>Anaiya, Kairen, and Cabriana are long time friends, wink. Eadyth is First Selecter as well as Sitter for the Blue Ajah!  Moiraine wears her kesiera for the first time in six years. Deference is required unless your Ajah or the Tower sets someone above you. On their way back to their rooms Cetalia Delarme intercepts them. She was not at the greeting ceremony. She has heard of Siuan's analytical ability. She offers Siuan a pattern which she quickly solves. Cetalia hustles Siuan back to her office and Moiraine returns to her rooms. Anaiya returns. Moiraine judges her to be nearly as strong as Cetalia. Anaiya offers her Healing to ease the tightness of the oaths. The tightness does not loosen but it feels more comfortable. She also brings a summons to see Tamra.</p>
                
                <p><strong>Siuan.</strong> Siuan and Moiraine kissed! Alrighty, Cetalia (blue) wants Siuan to be her assistant as e-a-e for the Blues. Siaun has no choice but to say yes. Siuan is a big fan of Moiraine. Tamra put Moiraine in charge of distributing the bounty. They both can't leave to hunt for the Dragon Reborn. Cetalia is the head of the Blue e-a-e. That was supposed to be secret. Moiraine reveals that the Tower wants her as Queen of Cairhien.</p>
                
                <p><strong>Lan.</strong> Hmm, I wonder if Lan will have an business with an Aes Sedai soon. lol. He doesn't seem like he's a huge fan of the Aes Sedai right now.</p>
                
                <p>Lan, Rakim, Caniedrin, Bukama scout the Aiel as they cross Kinslayer's Dagger heading to the Spine of the World. Lan rides Cat Dancer. Caniedrin wants to fight, but Bukama and Lan know that Pedron Niall, today's commander, knows war too well and will wait. Bukama talks Lan into waiting four months before returning to his battle with the Blight. They bypass Tar Valon and head south to Andor or perhaps Tear.</p>
                
                <h2>Ch 13, Business in the City, Wheel</h2>
                <p><strong>Moiraine.</strong> Well isn't this cute. Money and dress shopping lol. </p>
                
                <p>After dinner they are summoned back to Eadyth who gives them letters-of-rights for one thousand gold crowns. They will receive that much every year and more if needed. Siuan insists on depositing hers in the White Tower bank, but Moiraine goes to her own banker, Ilain Dormaile. Moiraine's family has been banking with her family for years.</p>
                
                <p>Ilain Dormaile tells Moiraine that nine days ago a tall Cairhienin man dressed as a Tower Guard captain giving his name as Ries Gorthanes tried to pry into Moiraine's affairs. She had him detained, but he bribed the guards. Ilain Dormaile had sent all of this in a letter to Moiraine, but Moiraine never received her letter, so Moiraine assumes that the Tower confiscated it, hoping to lull her. Nevertheless, someone who does not want her on the Sun Throne figured out the Tower's plan and is taking action. She starts planning and gives Mistress Dormaile instructions.</p>
                
                <p>The next day, after asking for recommendations, Moiraine and Siuan pay a call on Tamore Alkohima to order dresses. Moiraine orders twenty dresses while Siuan embarrasses her by being parsimonious. She tries to instruct Siuan in cultured protocol. Before leaving, Moiraine orders five more riding dresses in Cairhienin style with six slashes in red, green and white. She will send someone to pick them up rather than have them delivered. The second part of her plan is accomplished.</p>
                
                <h2>Ch 14, Changes, Square and Rope</h2>
                <p><strong>Moiraine.</strong> Now that, was awesome. Moiraine has left Tar Valon on the Bluewing, ready to set off on the grandest adventure ever... finding the Dragon Reborn!  Also, an AMYRLIN IS DEAD... now we have a new one. Wonder what happened? wink.</p>
                
                <p>Moiraine has a secret weave she's perfected.. unknown to us, wink. There are also A LOT OF FUN FESTIVLES in Cairhrien..</p>
                
                <p>Rafela and the other sisters begin instructing Siuan and Moiraine on Aes Sedai and Blue Ajah customs. There is long standing animosity between Red and Blue. The Blue Ajah is also a bit at odds with the White and Yellow over something in Altara a hundred years before. The Brown Ajah supports the White against the Blue, but supports the Blue against the Yellow. It is far more complicated than Daes Dae'mar.</p>
                
                <p>Siuan grows more and more frustrated working for Cetalia. Moiraine's time is spent doing paperwork for distributing the bounty. The day after the Feast of Lights, Ellid tests for the shawl, but she never returns from the oval ring. Elaida returns to Andor. She is as strong as they will eventually become, equal to Lelaine. Lelaine and Siuan get along well while Moiraine and Anaiya become friends. They also resume their Accepted friendship with Leane and also with Adine Canford.</p>
                
                <p>Three days later Ryma Galfrey enters the dining hall at breakfast. Weaving Air and Fire to amplify her voice, she announces that Tamra died in her sleep. - mhmmmmm.</p>
                
                <p>Moiraine's first thought is how to take advantage, then she regrets it. As personal penance, she wears a very light, inappropriate dress to the funeral to humiliate herself. The next day Sierin Vayu of the Gray Ajah is raised to the Amyrlin and she starts her rule with an iron hand. All male clerks are dismissed from the White Tower. Three sisters are exiled for a year and two are birched. Breaking tradition, she selects Red Ajah sisters, Amira as Mistress of Novices and Duhara as Keeper of the Chronicles.</p>
                
                <p>Moiraine goes to Sierin asking to be relieved of the bounty duty. Sierin agrees, but she commands Moiraine to stay in Tar Valon until she is needed. At this, Moiraine makes up her mind to leave. She says goodbye to Siuan. She shared a rough itinerary so Siuan can find her if needed. She then goes out for a "ride." Kairen, Sheriam and Eadyth note her departure, but she tells them she does not plan to cross a bridge. She rides Arrow to her bank and picks up letters-of-rights and coin from Mistress Dormaile. Guards accompany her to the seamstress where she picks up her dresses from Tamore. She then heads to Northharbor and finds a rivership, the Bluewing. Captain Carney tells her it is the fastest ship on the river. As they leave the dock, Moiraine sees Gorthanes talking to the harbormistress and looking at her ship. She has set off on the grandest adventure ever.</p>
                
                <h2>Ch 15, Into Canluum, Deer</h2>
                <p><strong>Lan.</strong> Ah so some time has past it seemes. Lan and Bukama are at the city of Canluum in Kandor - there are rumors of a man who can channel. Lan is recognized..</p>
                
                <p>he ruler of Canluum is Lord Varan Marcasiev; his banner is the Red Stag. At the city gate, a young guard addresses Lan as Tai'shar Malkier, true blood of Malkier, but Bukama lights into him for cutting his hair wrong and swearing to a Kandori lord. The other guards take notice of the altercation until an older guard, Alin Seroku appears. He also addresses Lan formally as son of el'Leanna and al'Akir. Bukama backs down and swears to keep the peace. The old guard again addresses them formally as Lan Mandragoran Dai Shan and Bukama Marenellin, hero of Salmarna. They ride into Canluum heading toward the Lord's castle on Stag's Stand, the highest peak in the city.</p>
                
                <p>There are several Aes Sedai around, more than normal since the previous Amyrlin died. COULD MOIRAINE BE HERE????</p>
                
                <p>They see another man from Malkier, Nazar Kurenin who now dresses in Kandori style. Malkier women wear a ki'sain, a dot of paint on their forehead to show their marital status. Worried about Bukama's reaction to all the displaced Malkier, Lan heads them to a quiet inn instead of the palace.</p>
                
                <h2>Ch 16, The Deeps, Helmet</h2>
                <p><strong>Lan.</strong> 6 men against Lan.. DANG! Alright, Lan has some gold to buy a new horse... and he and Bukama and Ryne are on their way to Chachin. Ryne is Lan's best friend, five years older. He is Malkier, but dresses like an Arafellin. Lan almost laid with a servig girl named Lira.. whoa. Lan's first lover was Edeyn and she was 30 when he was 15. We also get Lan's ring. Also Lan has a locket of drawings of his mother and father. </p>
                
                <p>Ryne arrived yesterday, working as a merchant's guard out of Shol Arbela, but the merchant who was known for his luck was killed last night. The serving girl Lira likes Lan. Ryne expected Lan to be in Chachin because of Edeyn Arrel. She has been from Fal Moran to Maradon raising support for the Golden Crane to retake Malkier from the Blight. Lan is shaken and goes for a walk to the stable. She was his carneira, his first lover, in Fal Moran. He was fifteen and she was over thirty. Lan uses ko'di, a oneness or void, to focus his concentration.</p>
                
                <p>Before Malkier was Rhamdashar, before that, Aramaelle. Lan has four gifts from the cradle, a locket with his parents images, the ring of Malkier kings, his sword and an oath to defend Malkier to the death. Bukama finds him in the stable and checks on Sun Lance. He tells Lan that Ryne said many men, even Nazar Kurenin are willing to follow him.</p>
                
                <h2>Ch 17, An Arrival, Ornaments</h2>
                <p><strong>Moiraine.</strong> Oh boy, I know that chapter icon now.. also hmm, I wonder who Moiraine's Warder will be?? We meet Cadsuane, a formidable Green who is a beast - born to command. She embarrasses Moiraine, after recognizing her. Moiraine has been out of the Tower for three months now and is pretending to be.. Lady Alys (wink) a Cairhienin lady of a minor house. Trying to find the Dragon Reborn!</p>
                
                <p>Moiraine says she is going to Chachin, then regrets her words. Her next targets are Avene Sahera in a village on the way and Lady Ines Demain in Chachin. Cadsuane brings up age, shocking the others. She says Meilyn is older, and when they are gone, Kerene Nagashi will be strongest.</p>
                
                <p>There is a sharp drop to the next five, one retired, including Moiraine and Siuan when they reach full strength. She is the strongest in the last thousand years. Meilyn and Kerene are the strongest in the last six hundred. Cadsuane orders Moiraine to go with Merean and Larelle to Chachin to help keep her from doing anything dumb. Both sisters object as strongly as Moiraine. They only met the day before and both want to stay in Canluum two or three days longer. Moiraine has been Aes Sedai four months.</p>
                
                <p>Cadsuane says she is already taking more risks than she knows. Cadsuane will be checking on her during the night. Moiraine wonders about Cadsuane bringing up Meilyn Arganya and Kerene Nagashi, two of Tamra's searchers.</p>
                
                <h2>Ch 18, A Narrow Passage, Darkfriend</h2>
                <p>Moiraine. See this.. this is SCARY! Because we are in Moiraine's head and they're talking about the Black Ajah. The Black Ajah might be after Siuan and Moiraine... yikes. This was well written and scary lol.</p>
                
                <p>Siuan tells Moiraine that all five of the searchers, Aisha, Kerene, Valera, Ludice and Meilyn, are dead. Aisha and her Warder were killed by bandits in Murandy. Kerene fell off a ship in the Alguenya River. Meilyn returned to the White Tower after the other four died. Siuan wanted to speak to her in secret so she hid under her bed. Meilyn never showed, but at breakfast next morning Chesmal announced that she died in her sleep. Moiraine convinces Siuan to head on to Chachin.</p>
                
                <p>With her worries she cannot sleep. When Cadsuane checks on her, she opens herself to saidar causing Cadsuane to mutter about the fool girl. Moiraine gets up and reluctantly leaves most of her possessions behind. She wears a riding dress with embroidery like Maldine lace as she leaves her room.</p>
                
                <h2>Ch 19, Pond Water, Wheel</h2>
                <p><strong>Moiraine.</strong> Oh yes, the famous Moiraine falling into the pond story... hahahahah! I'm 100% serious in saying, this is so good. I've missed the simple story, with riding a horse on a road. Ah! Such nostalgia for EOTW and the early books wow. lol</p>
                
                <p>Moiraine thought she could sneak up on Lan, yeah right! She is a good tracker and follows the lone man. She finds him sitting beside a pond alone. She tries to take his sword but he is too fast. He grabs her and throws her in the pond.</p>
                
                <p>They are Lan, Ryne and Bukama. Lan and Ryne play a sword game which Ryne wins every time. Moiraine asks for their escort to Chachin and they agree. Ryne is handsome and friendly while Bukama and Lan are taciturn. She never gets a chance to ask Ryne about The Gates of Heaven. As they bed down, she weaves wards of Spirit around them so she will know if they move. At one point when they change guards, she hears Lan say he does not trust Aes Sedai.</p>
                
                <p>Angry, she weaves Air, Water and a touch of Earth and dumps a bunch of the pond on him. They think it must be Shadowspawn but then she reveals that she is Aes Sedai. Ryne looks at her with awe and fear.  She goes to sleep thinking about him.</p>
                
                <h2>Ch 20, Breakfast in Manala, Trollocs!</h2>
                <p><strong>Lan.</strong> Love this. Lan asks Moiraine where she's seen Trollocs and she says, with the best Aes Sedai answer.. "in places he's never dreamed of" haha!</p>
                
                <p>Lan is wary of Alys. He dislikes both Aes Sedai and Cairhienin and she claims to be both. Ryne seems besotted with her. They travel north and stop at the town of Manala for breakfast. Bel Tine festivities are underway. There are six Trolloc heads on posts from a recent raid.</p>
                
                <p>Lan finds her in an alley, sneaks in and overhears her asking Mistress Marishna about Avene Sahera. Alys coldly chides him for eavesdropping. Lan is again impressed that she heard him while he was being quiet. He thinks she might be after Ryne as a Warder. He offers to help her find Avene Sahera and she tells him not to meddle in Aes Sedai affairs. She sends him back to the inn to wait until she is ready to leave. He and Bukama still wonder why she was following them.</p>
                
                <h2>Ch 21, Some Tricks of the Power, Flame</h2>
                <p><strong>Lan.</strong> Moiraine is so childish hahaha, Lan is doing his best to grin and bear it all lol. </p>
                
                <p>Lan, Ryne and Bukama escort Alys as they ride to Chachin. When thunderstorms come out of the Blight she creates a shield to keep them dry. She stops at every village asking after Avene Sahera. She continues to probe at their pasts and plans, and she continues to torment Lan. The second night she keeps him awake with flicks and the third night she fills his clothes with sand. At noon on the fourth day they are attacked by forty brigands led by Coy. Cat Dancer knows how to respond in a fight. Alys uses the One Power to frighten them off. That night ants bite him and the next night she uses blisterleaf. Lan feels that he must bear her remonstrations until she is satisfied, but he thinks she might kill him.</p>
                
                <p><strong>Moiraine.</strong> Ahh, I thought Moiraine was going to slip in and Bond Lan when she Healed him! </p>
                
                <p>Two days from Chachin, Moiraine finds Avene Sahera in the village Ravinda, but her son Migel was born too early and in the wrong place. She is using the bounty to build a new inn and intends to call it The White Tower. Moiraine figures the name will last until the first Aes Sedai sees it.</p>
                
                <p>As they leave Ravinda, Moiraine decides to use wasps on Lan next. She asks if he is allergic. He turns looking stunned. There is an arrow in his shoulder. Moiraine quickly reacts blocking the next arrow with Air while Bukama and Ryne shoot the assassin. The assassin is Caniedrin. He was paid to kill Moiraine, but he dies before he can reveal more. Moiraine wonders if it was Gorthanes who hired him. She searches the body but finds only his payment, ten Cairhienin gold crowns. Ryne and Bukama remove the arrow and Moiraine Heals Lan. His wounds from Canluum are also Healed. Moiraine thinks she has only two more nights to break Lan. She will be far too busy once they reach Chachin.</p>
                
                <h2>Ch 22, Keeping Custom, Horse</h2>
                <p><strong>Lan.</strong> Oh no! Lan, she can't do this to you! They're in Chachin now. </p>
                
                <p>At noon they cross the Bridge of Sunrise into Chachin. Glad to be rid of her, he gallops Cat Dancer into the city and Ryne and Bukama follow and they head to the Aesdaishar Palace. It is adorned with banners of the prancing Red Horse. At the gates to the palace, a dozen guards block their way. Lan introduces himself and an old comrade, Jurad Shiman welcomes them greeting Lan with Tai'shar Malkier.</p>
                
                <p>Among the other nobles is Edeyn ti Gemallen Arrel.  She still wears the white ki'sain of a widow. When Lan greets her she kneels and pledges fealty to Lan as king of Malkier. Lan and Brys go to a private balcony for a long talk. They discuss the Aiel War and rumors of a man who can channel. Brys tells Lan of a message from Ethenielle that two Aes Sedai caught an impostor in a village to the south.</p>
                
                <p>When Lan returns to his rooms he finds Edeyn waiting for him. She plans for him to marry her seventeen-year-old daughter Iselle. She still holds his daori, the braid of hair from one's carneira cut at their first time. This means that he still owes her. She takes him to bed.</p>
                
                <h2>Ch 23, The Evening Star, Fish</h2>
                <p><strong>Moiraine.</strong> WHOOOOOA, Moiraine, a little Blue secret weave of Spirit to scare this inkeeper into drinking and telling her what she knows?! WHOA! Also, Moiraine loves her horse, don't you dare try to steal her.</p>
                
                <p>Moiraine spends the rest of the day searching to no avail. As evening falls Siuan finally finds her. She is staying at The Evening Star, an upscale inn. The innkeeper, Ailene Tolvina allows Moiraine to stay with Siuan. Moiraine tells her that Avene Sahera is not the one. Siuan tells her that Ines Demain is staying in the Aesdaishar Palace. She is newly a widow. She named her son Rahien ("dawn" in the Old Tongue), because she saw the dawn come up over Dragonmount. The hot news is that a young blacksmith who was very lucky died a couple of nights ago, but they do not see how that could be connected to Meilyn, Tamra and the Black Ajah.</p>
                
                <p>Moiraine makes a plan to enter the Aesdaishar Palace. At least Queen Ethenielle's Aes Sedai advisor is with her away from the palace.</p>
                
                <h2>Ch 24, Making Use of Invisibility, Sun</h2>
                <p><strong>Moiraine.</strong> Moiraine is cahsing in one of her letter-to-rights.. they also get new dresses made. They go to the Aesdaishar Palace, is no one going to mention the word Aesdaishar is kind of like Aes Sedai - Dai shar.. isn't that what Warders are called daishar? nope, gaidin.. so nothing like what I've been thinking for the past 10 chapters hahahah.</p>
                
                <p>The next morning Moiraine gets her dresses and by midmorning they arrive at the Aesdaishar Palace as Lady Moiraine Damodred and her maid 'Suki.' As a high ranking noble she is welcomed and given an apartment of three rooms, two serving women and an errand boy.</p>
                
                <p>Moiraine asks and is relieved to learn that there are no Aes Sedai in the palace. She still plans to leave as soon as possible in case another Aes Sedai or Gorthanes hears of her presence. Siuan slips out and makes use of her invisibility as a maid. She soon returns with bad news. Ines Demain's husband fell dead ten days ago. He was an older man but she loved him so she will not come out of seclusion for a full month. Moiraine must reveal herself as Aes Sedai to force an interview. Siuan says she will try to talk to one of her servants instead.</p>
                
                <p>One of the maids, Aiko, announces the shatayan who has come to escort Moiraine to an interview with Prince Brys. Siuan will go talk to a young footman named Cal.</p>
                
                <h2>Ch 25, An Answer, Helmet</h2>
                <p><strong>Moiraine.</strong> The cat is out of the bag.. Lan knows Moiraine is Aes Sedai, and Moiraine knows Lan is King of Malkier. Also, Siuan is kissing boys and Moiraine does. not. like. it!</p>
                
                <p>Moiraine learns that Lan really would have been king of Malkier. Claiming fatigue, Moiraine asks leave and a maid Elis takes her to her rooms. They round a corner and run into Merean with the shatayan. She lets out that Moiraine is Aes Sedai and says that Larelle decided to go south.</p>
                
                <p>She decides to go see Lan after all. Two serving women and an errand boy are in his rooms. Lan is practicing the sword. She asks for his help. Lan hates Aes Sedai because they did not help Malkier. In return for his help, Moiraine explains that a hundred sisters were sent, but they arrived too late. She asks Lan to have Bukama follow Merean Redhill and he agrees. Back in her apartments she finds that word she is Aes Sedai has spread. Lady Iselle is there with Siuan. She wears a blue ki'sain. She wants to go to the White Tower to be Aes Sedai of the Green Ajah. She would not mind Lan as her carneira, but she does not want to marry yet. She was tested years ago when she was twelve.</p>
                
                <p>After she leaves, Siuan reports that she learned nothing from Cal except that he can kiss. She reminds Moiraine of kissing Cormanes the night she left for the White Tower. Moiraine tells Siuan to do anything she can to reach Lady Ines Demain. Late that night Siuan returns. Bukama reported to her that Merean spent the whole day with Lord Brys. Cal told her that Rahien was born the day after the Aiel began their retreat, the day after Gitara's Foretelling. They do not understand why Merean, either one of Tamra's searchers or Black Ajah, spent time with Brys instead of Ines. What they do not know could kill the Dragon Reborn.</p>
                
                <h2>Ch 26, When to Surrender, Darkfriend</h2>
                <p><strong>Lan.</strong> WHAT?! BUKAMA DEAD?! SOMEONE TRIED TO KILL LAN?! LAN IS VERY LUCKY?! Lan is going to find Moiraine. Also, Anya, Esne, and Bulen are loyal to Edeyn. </p>
                
                <p>She will give his daori to Iselle and force them to marry. He feels trapped to the point he has no choice but to run, but he must convince Bukama. Moving quietly as he can, he spots Merean talking to Iselle. Iselle leaves and Merean follows her. Lan goes on his way, but as he reaches a flight of stairs his feet are pulled from under him and he tumbles down, very lucky to be okay. It must have been the One Power meaning an Aes Sedai tried to kill him. A servant runs up and tells him that Bukama was stabbed. By the time Lan arrives he is dead. Lan goes to find Moiraine.</p>
                
                <p><strong>Moiraine.</strong> YIKES! Merean, BLACK AJAH. Ryne, DARKFRIEND. Brys, DEAD. Diryk, DEAD. Iselle, DEAD. </p>
                
                <p>Merean is / was old; she was Aes Sedai a hundred years before Moiraine's great grandmother was born. At the balcony they find Brys, Diryk and Iselle with Merean and Ryne. Merean got Iselle to bring Diryk to her, but she brought Brys, too. Merean has Brys and Diryk bound with Air, intending to kill them. Ryne is with Merean. He is a Darkfriend and he killed Bukama. Merean is too strong for Moiraine to shield. She orders Ryne to kill Lan and make certain of it this time.</p>
                
                <p>Merean wants to know what Moiraine is doing there. Ryne and Lan fight. Merean and Moiraine fight. Moiraine severs Merean's attack with Air and Fire. Merean drops Diryk off the balcony. As Moiraine dives for Diryk, Merean knocks her out, then drops Brys off the balcony. Moiraine comes to, but is too groggy to hold saidar. In desperation she stabs Merean in the back. Iselle starts to fall. Moiraine grabs her hand, but cannot hold on. Lan kills Ryne.</p>
                
                <p>Moiraine Heals Lan with Spirit, Air and Water, then disposes of Merean's and Ryne's bodies.</p>

                <p><strong>Moiraine.</strong> Beautiful. Absolutely beautiful. Also, that is interesting, if that is the case for all Black Ajah goals - excessive luck or sudden rise in prominence. Hmm. I LOVED MOIRAINE BONDING LAN. WHOA! </p>
                
                <p>Moiraine searches Merean's belongings but finds nothing so she destroys them. She returns to her rooms to find Siuan. She learned that Rahien was born in a farmhouse two miles from Dragonmount. They discuss the events of the past day. Siuan figures that the Black Ajah did not get the time of the Dragon Reborn's birth, only that he is reborn. They are killing anyone showing signs of potential for channeling such as excessive luck or sudden rise in prominence.</p>
                
                <p>Siuan will go back to the White Tower and Moiraine will continue the search. Siuan says Lan left an hour ago; Moiraine follows. Outside of town, she catches up to him. He is burning his daori. Moiraine tells him all about the Dragon Reborn. He swears fealty to her and she bonds him as her Warder with an intricate weave of Spirit. She can now draw on his strength. Lan led five hundred men at the Battle of the Shining Walls; half died. They head back to Chachin, then to Arafel, then the world.</p>

                <p>I'm going to read this prior to reading A Memory of Light, this is only 300 pages or so - I think I can manage that without too much time before A Memory of Light.</p>
