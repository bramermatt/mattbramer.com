<h2 id="why">I'm Interested In..</h2>
<p>I try to keep this topic updated, but the last update I gave was in July. You can read that post <a href="../interests/july-22.html">here</a>!</p>

<p>I'm have a bit of an addictive personality, which would explain the following interests.</p>


<h2>Physics</h2>
<p>I really can only assume this love of Physics comes from watching the Big Bang Theory TV show, but man, I'm just so fascinated by Physics. As I am currently studying Computer Science, I really enjoy the secondary classes that pertain to physics. Those are fun!</p>


<h2>Big Bang Theory TV Series</h2>
<p>My family and I are doing another full series rewatch now! We first did a rewatch when our son, Everett, was born! We love the show and so does Everett.</p>


<h2>Brandon Sandersonâ€™s Cosmere</h2>
<p>I'm doing a full blown review of the Cosmere! Check it out: <a href="../../../html/cosmere-in-review.html">Here</a>!
</p>


<h2>Web development</h2>
<p>I love making websites and inspecting all other websites with the Web-Inspect feature!</p>


<h2>Call of Duty Modern Warfare 2</h2>
<p>This game is great! I have only played a few hours and I've uploaded a few recordings of my gameplay!</p>
