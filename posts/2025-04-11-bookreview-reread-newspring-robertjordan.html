                <p>I've already reviewed the book in depth, but let me just say: New Spring was a genuinely enjoyable read. It’s shorter than the main books, but still rich with the worldbuilding and character work that makes The Wheel of Time so compelling. I decided to pick it up again because the Amazon Prime show reignited my interest in the series. I’m not planning a full re-read right now, but I wanted to revisit some key moments—and this prequel, with its early look at Lan and Moiraine, was the perfect choice. It gave me just enough of that familiar magic and mystery without the time commitment of a main series volume. It reminded me why I loved this world in the first place.</p>
