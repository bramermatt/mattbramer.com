        <p>This is one of my favorite books in the Stormlight Archive. It’s such an enjoyable read. It’s short, which is something that you don’t typically see in Brandon Sanderson’s work. With Edgedancer’s length, so much is accomplished. We are re-introduced to Lift, an Edgedancer with an incredibly interesting ability…</p>

        <p>Lift is a character who is young, in this world and in general, she is thirteen in a world that treats her as that. She is not mature, but she is bursting with compassion for everyone she meets. She is the definition of a truly good heart. She is wonderful. She is funny, and she is an interesting protagonist, because she keeps being happy no matter her situation or past. It is exactly what you’d need in a world like Roshar.</p>
            
        <p>This book also has an incredible amount of world-building is such off-hand conversations. It is great, and exactly what this book needed to make it so good.</p>
            
        <p>I love this book. This is my second time reading this book. Read my first review <a href="../posts/2022-11-8-bookreview-edgedancer-brandonsanderson.html">(Here)</a>!</p>
