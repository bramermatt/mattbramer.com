                <h2>Written Review</h2>
                <p>With tears in my eyes, I close one of the most dense and detailed biography that I've ever read. To complete this tome was a challenge and a victory. My goodness, gracious, was this a superb read. George Washington, America's first President, and the epitome of the phrase: "the man, the myth, the legend". Wow. Does this biography make me want to run out and buy a horse and be an outdoorsman while also joining the military, and running for President? No. But, this was something special to read. </p>
                
                <p>To read of Washington's death, and then Martha's death shortly after, was very difficult. I had goosebumps and tears in my eyes as I read of the descriptions that George Washington went through nearing his death. The removal of his blood and the grim depictions of the doctors at work and Washington with his own hand to his wrist to check his own pulse as he expired. VERY DIFFICULT. </p>
                
                <p>But, there is so much to talk about here and I can't stop talking about this book..</p>
