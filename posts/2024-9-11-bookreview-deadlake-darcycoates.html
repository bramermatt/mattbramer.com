                <h2>Written Review</h2>
<p>Dead Lake by Darcy Coates is a thrilling, quick-paced novella that keeps you hooked from the first page. It’s a perfect example of why I enjoy short horror stories—the tension never lets up, and there’s no room for filler. From the moment Sam arrives at her uncle’s secluded lake house, you know something eerie is on the horizon. Yet, Coates skillfully keeps you guessing, playing with your expectations in a way that makes the story even more gripping.</p>

<p>What stands out most about Dead Lake is how well Coates balances suspense and atmosphere. Despite the novella’s length, she takes her time building the world around the lake and the isolation Sam feels. You can practically sense the cold wind coming off the water and the creak of the trees in the silence. As I read, I found myself on edge, as though I was right there with Sam, peering out into the dark woods, unsure of what might emerge.</p>

<p>The character of Sam is easy to connect with, which makes the story even more tense. She’s an artist looking for peace and quiet to finish her work, but instead, she’s faced with inexplicable terror. I appreciated how real she felt—her reactions and emotions were believable and grounded, which made the horror that much more intense. Darcy Coates does an excellent job of getting into her head, allowing the reader to experience the fear and uncertainty right alongside her.</p>

<p>The pacing of the story is spot-on. It’s fast, but not rushed, allowing just enough time to build dread before plunging into the action. One of the things I love about Darcy Coates is her ability to maintain a constant sense of unease. Even when nothing overtly terrifying is happening, there’s a lingering feeling that something isn’t right. This underlying tension makes the moments of actual horror hit harder when they finally arrive.</p>

<p>The novella format works well for Dead Lake. It doesn’t overstay its welcome, and the short length makes it perfect for reading in one or two sittings. The story doesn’t need to drag out the mystery or explain every detail, which in turn leaves the reader’s imagination to run wild. It’s a fine line between leaving too much unsaid and striking the right balance of ambiguity, but Coates handles it expertly.</p>

<p>While Dead Lake is by no means a groundbreaking horror story, it is a solid, enjoyable read. It’s a great option if you’re looking for something quick, well-written, and atmospheric. The book reminded me of why I love the genre: sometimes, all you need is a creepy setting, a compelling protagonist, and a mystery that keeps you turning pages long after you should be asleep. If you're a fan of psychological horror that emphasizes mood over gore, Dead Lake should definitely be on your list.</p>

<p>Overall, Dead Lake is a fun, exciting, and eerie novella that will leave you looking over your shoulder and questioning the safety of isolated retreats. Darcy Coates delivers a chilling tale that sticks with you, making it well worth the read.</p>
