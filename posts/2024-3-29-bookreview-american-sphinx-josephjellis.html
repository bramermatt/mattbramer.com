                <h2>Written Review</h2>
<p>Started Reading March 21, 2024.</p>

<p>This feels, as I begin reading, like this is going to be a strange "review". This is a biography of the character of Thomas Jefferson. A non-fiction book. I primarily read Fantasy Fiction. So, this is going to be fun!</p>

<p>Well, there it is. Thomas Jefferson, one of the authors of the Declaration of Independence, a Founding Father of the United States of America - slave owner - had an illicit affair with a slave he owned, Sally Hemming, and had at least one child with. Very interesting.</p>

<p>Well, this was absolutely astounding for me! I am impressed with, specifically the prose of the writing of Joseph J. Ellis. Additionally, the detail at which Ellis has brought forth in this biography has been excellent. This is the first biography that I've ever read, but this has been really enlightening so far. Not putting the character of Thomas Jefferson on a pedestal - that is great! This has been very wonderful so far!</p>

<p>I am learning so much, honestly. I am still really enjoying this dive into the character of Thomas Jefferson. I'll say, he's not that great of a father or man being that he enjoyed the dalliances with married women or widows. I am just reading what is written. It is hard to read sometimes, being a husband and father myself.</p>

<p>This is quite the interesting perspective of a person I knew very little about. I knew Thomas Jefferson was our third president. And well, that's about it. Until I saw Hamilton the Musical, I still knew very little of Thomas Jefferson. Now, I see this flawed, introspective, contradictory thinker, and all-together thoughtful man. It is extraordinary to see his writings and his ideas put to page, in a way that I am learning so much and am finding an incredible time enjoying.</p>

<p>Thomas Jefferson's views on things like Slavery are hard to understand, being that I have nearly 200 years of hindsight to look back on. I'm really enjoying this book, it is an awesome look into someone's life, especially a president. When I began reading this book I was utterly floored by the notes and discussions around the creating and signing of the Declaration of Independence. That is something I look forward to learning about more.</p>

<p>The epilogue and the Appendix were somewhat hard to read. According to evidence in 1998, Thomas Jefferson had an illicit affair with Sally Hemmings, his slave. And beyond a reasonable doubt, fathered her seven children. That is crazy. Also, the Jeffersonian Political Ideals have almost all been completely lost to time - as in no one follows his ideas any longer - besides the natural human rights. Slavery: abolished, Races in Harmony: still working on it today, and more. It's hard to read, because this life that Jefferson led is just a mark on American's historical calendar.</p>

<p>His life can be noted down by a few historically significant things. And that's it. The writer of the Declaration of Independence. Third American President. Creator of the University of Virigina. The Louisiana Purchase. Wow.</p>
