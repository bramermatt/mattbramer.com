<h2>When I Started Reading</h2>
<p>I'm really happy to be back reading the Wheel of Time. Make sure to check out my <a href="../pages/wheel-of-time-in-review.html">Wheel of Time in Review</a>!</p>

<p>I am currently reading, as of June 5, 2023, so this is going to be a review in progress! And below, I'm going to have notes as I read, by chapter. More than likely spoilers, so I'm going to keep those hidden by the box below. When I've finished my read, the Notes box will be moved below the spoiler box, probably past the score!</p>

<h2>Written Review</h2>
<p>Book Seven had a lot of expectations to reach, after the ending of Book Six - Lord of Chaos. I felt this fell a little flat for me. I read this in two weeks, and that was good. I didn't feel this was a SLOG, but I my socks weren't blown off. A good Wheel of Time book for sure!</p>

<p>The more I think about this book.. I really liked it, but it hasn't been my favorite Wheel of Time book. Still a 4 out of 5 for me. Not a 5 out of 5 like the others! Hopefully A Path of Daggers gets a higher score.</p>

<blockquote>I'm more excited for the next book.. A Crown of Swords Review (SPOILER FREE)
</blockquote>

<h2>Spoilers</h2>
<p>Just a bit of preamble here.. the way this review will be is a lot of different from others. I'm wrote notes on every single chapter that I read. Which is completely spoiler, so this is where the spoilers start.. read at your own risk!</p>

<p>And now I'm adding in predictions for upcoming books and more! Check that out below.</p>

<details id="spoilers">
<summary>Spoilers</summary>

<h2>Spoiler Review</h2>
<p>This book, I wanted to love. I didn't love it as much I did Lord of Chaos. This book didn't really do much in terms of plot, it really setup for the next books I'm guessing. But I felt this book fell flat. I was expecting a lot, that was probably my fault. </p>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>This book also only took place over 10 days, which really makes you put into perspective that not much happened this book. That might be while I'm so hung up. I wanted so much more from this and I feel like only a few things happened. </p>

<h2>Rand</h2>
<p>I'm really interested to see what happens next! The start, Rand comes back after Dumai's Wells and he is in a bad place after all those deaths because of him, he didn't kill them himself, but he helped form the Asha'man and a bunch of people came to his rescue to kill A LOT OF SHAIDO. That's a lot for Rand, and this book we see a bit of the aftermath of that in Rand's mood. Rand also has sex with Min, that was an odd scene because Rand and Min just learned of Herid Fell's death and emotions were running in strange directions. But they did. An old Aes Sedai, Cadsuane, comes in and Rand is having trouble with her.</p>

<h2>Perrin</h2>
<p>We got Rand banishing Perrin with a bunch of people including Faile and Berelain, and some Two Rivers men - to get Masema and bring him to Rand. Masema is a lot crazy, so I can't even imagine what is going to happen next with that. Before that, Perrin spent a lot of time trying to make up with Faile. They did… wink. </p>

<h2>Mat</h2>
<p>Mat was very ta'veren this book. Also, there was some horrible things that happened to Mat. He was sexually assaulted by a Queen. He thought she would stop, but she didn't. Now Mat has to live with that forever. </p>

<h2>Nynaeve</h2>
<p>I still love Nynaeve. This book, she acted a like a very stubborn human would, in how she treated Mat. </p>

<h2>Aviendha</h2>
<p>Oh, Aviendha didn't do much this book. She was just kind of here. She tasted sea water and didn't like it. Anything else?</p>

<summary>Predictions and Theories</summary>
<h2>Predictions</h2>
<p>Let's see how I do, when I check back here after a few books.</p>

<h2>From Lord of Choas</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Who is the lord of chaos, We still don't know.</li>
    <li>Where is Logain, We didn't see Logain at all this book.</li>
    <li>The cloud bowl, will it work? We got the bowl in the second to last chapter, haven't used it yet.</li>
    <li>Moiraine, Still dead, might be a part of some prophecies.</li>
    <li>Lan, Made it to Myrelle,then Egwene opened a Gateway for Lan to get to Ebou Dar.. then he got to Ebou Dar and saved Nynaeve from drowning and then Nynaeve was able to break her block by surrendering. Then Lan and Nynaeve got married!</li>
</ol>

<h2>What's Next?</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Mat's Dice, Okay, so Mat ending this book with a building falling on top of him as the Seanchan invaded Ebou Dar. I have no idea what the Dice are really for, and I want to know what is going on. Also, I don't believe Mat dead.. can't be!</li>
    <li>Alanna's Bond, We keep getting little bits of this, but I'm really interested in this. I want to know if Rand will be able to break this or not.</li>
    <li>Moiraine is Not Dead, From the Fires of Heaven, I still think Moiraine is not dead. Neither is Lanfear. We don't know much about where they are - in that doorway ter'angreal. No way they're dead! I'm excited to learn more about them.</li>
    <li>LTT in Rand's Head, The end of this book didn't have much about this, I'm still interested!</li>
    <li>The Watcher, Moirdin, I THINK THIS IS ISHAMAEL! We haven't gotten any confirmation, but I THINK IT'S ISHAMAEL. I'm so excited about this prediction. Because.. (this is from chapter 20) The Watcher. Okay, I'm going to rant a bit here. THIS IS ISHAMAEL! YES YES YES! Oh, i'm so excited about this prediction. This is Ishamael. He's back! Using the **True Power** holy cow!! WOW. Okay, first off, I was wrong, the two Caddar and Maisia was Sammael and Graendal. ANyway, this is Ishamael, for sure. I am excited to learn more about this True Power, the one that Lanfear and.. someone I can't remember was trying to get/use in the Rhuidean visions. Wow. Okay, so this True Power comes straight from the Great Lord and the Watcher... Ishamael, sees black flecks in his vision. Gosh I'm just so excited about this prediction. Mesaan ahad a hand in kidnapping Rand. Graendal won't risk teaching the Wise Ones Compulsion unless Sammael has found a binder.. nice! The Watcher, Ishamael, is covered in fancloth except for his eyes so he can't be seen. Graendal hates the name Maisia. Sammael opens a Gateway, and eventually Graendal follows. The Watcher feels the prickling of saidar end and smiles crookedly. He decides not to kill the eight women. AND RIPS A HOLE IN THE PATTERN WITH THE TRUE POWER AND STEPS OUTSIDE THE PATTERN. HO-LY CRAP! Ishamael. Ishamael. Also more and more predictions. Ishamael will be Nae'blis. Ishamael is the Lord of Chaos. Ishamael. YES YES YES!<br><br>Why do I think that? Honestly, I think this only because we've gotten Osan'gar and Aran'gar come back, so now we know that Forsaken can come back. But this True Power thing has me feeling Ishamael. It was a feeling I got with how knowledgable the Water seemed with the world and Sammi and Graendi. And how excited he was to use the True Power. And his skin prickled when Graendi channeled. And this person is clearly from AOL and at least super knowledgeable with saidin and the Pattern to be able to step outside. And I am just begging for Ishi to come back.. lol</li>
    <li>Egwene and Aes Sedai Fealty, Egwene has several Aes Sedai swear featly directly to Egwene and that hasn't happened EVER BEFORE. I'm excited to find out what are the ramifications for this.</li> 
    <li>Cadsuane, She is probably not a Darkfriend, but she is fiesty. She isn't going to be good for Rand or Asha'man.</li>
    <li>Seanchan, THEY'RE BACK! Oh this is going to be crazy, I'm so excited about this.</li>
</ol>

<summary>Notes As I Read</summary>

<h2>Prologue, Lightnings, Wheel and Snake</h2>
<p><strong>Elaida.</strong> Okay, let's talk her own Palace as Amyrlin.. weird right? She asked the neareset stedding: Stedding Jentoine in the Black Hills for help and they declined. Her clock was commissioned by Cemaile Sorenthaine, raised from the Gray Ajah three hundred years ago. Now, a lot of news in the world, but what I really care about it the note from Galina that say's Rand has been haptured.. hmm, sorry Elaida he broke free! I look forward to seeing that realization. Next, notes of Elayne, Nynaeve and *two others* in Ebou Dar (Aviendha and Birgitte). Elaida tells Alviarin to send order to Teslyn and Joline to capture the girls with forkroot again. A Green Ajah agent in Caemlyn reports four hundred men in the Black Tower.. WOO! SO MANY ASHA'MAN! Interesting the Red Ajah have only found twenty-four in the last twenty years, maybe because they can't test them? I'm not sure. Elaida learned about Egwene, and she wants to increase the White Tower Guard because of the supposed twenty thousand men Gareth Bryne is bringin to the White Tower. I look forward to seeing this.. if it happens!</p>

<p>Elaida has a Fortelling.. "The White Tower will be whole again, except for remnants cast out and scorned, whole and stronger than ever. Rand al'Thor will face the Amyrlin and know her anger. The Black Tower will be rent in blood and fire, and sisters will walk its grounds. This I Foretell." So, this will come true, because it's a Fortelling.. right? But that doesn't mean all will happen like Elaida expects. Like the White Tower whole again: yeah, Egwene as Amylin (my guess). Rand will face Amyrlin and know her anger: Egwene. Black Tower rent with blood and sisters walk its ground: Sisters killed by the Black Tower (that's what I hope, but this could go the way it says). Which, I don't want the Black Tower gone, but we'll see.</p>

<p><strong>Sevanna.</strong> Hey, cool, Dumai's Wells from Sevanna's perspective. Is there more to say then Sevanna still has this box that is supposed to help her take Rand? This was great to see another perspective!</p>

<p><strong>Alviarin.</strong> Hey hey, this is cool! So, I'm *really* interested in this now! Masaana in the White tower, hiding her ability to channel... inverted weaves (right?)! So, Ishamael made Alviarin the head of the Black Ajah?! WHOA! Lanfear and Graendal have visited the White Tower, and Be'lal yanked Alviarin out of her sleep to *some strange place*... oh oh! Apparently Elaida's orders were to kidnap the King of Illian and the Queen of Saldea, and offer kingship of Tear to High Lord Darlin.. but does she even have the power to do that? I like Mesaana's "you children almost match the ajah at times"... could that be the Ajahs from the AOL? A Great Council of Thirteen heas the Black Ajah... spooky! I LOVE IT! Mesaana doesn't care about the Black Tower. Mesaana also warns Alviarin to only serve her, not Semirhage, Demandred, or Graendal. MESAANA TEACHES ALVIARIN HOW TO TRAVEL! I'm so excited about this. BLACK AJAH PLOT! BLACK AJAH PLOT!</p>

<p><strong>Pedron Niall.</strong> WHOA! Niall has been stabbed by Omerna?! WHOA! Then Eamon Valda killed Omerna for treason! Faisar's message to Niall was confirming the Seanchan invasion in Tarabon. Also, Morgase really wants to see Galad. IS NIALL GOING TO DIE? Reading on!</p>

<p><strong>Eamon Valda.</strong> Pedron Niall is dead. Wow. You know, for the horrible crew the Whitecloaks are, I liked the sneaky Pedron Niall. But here we go. Eamon Valda will be Lord Captain Commander. Valda really wants Morgase, to kill her since she's a *witch*. And Valda doesn't like Balwer. Wow.</p>

<p><strong>Gawyn.</strong> We're back at Dumai's Wells. Gawyn wishes he killed Rand, he keeps thinking that. Gawyn also sees an Aes Sedai fall, and we don't know who this is. I can't think of who this might be.. could be Galina if she knows how to Travel?? Since she is gone when Gawyn gets there? Maybe. Then some more Aiel come to fight with Gawyn's 200 Younglings Gawyn killed 4 Aiel and that's cool, go Gawyn. The Younglings start to make camp, and plan to head back to Tar Valon.</p>

<p>Okay, that's the Prologue.. very good! Here we go to A Crown of Swords!</p>

<h2>Ch 1, High Chasaline, Wolf</h2>
<p><strong>Perrin.</strong> Wind blows from Braem Wood past relics of Coremanda, then past the Tar Valon Road. Perrin is there a day after the battle at Dumai's Wells, and at the main camp a mile south of Dumai's Wells. Perrin is worried about Faile in Cairhien. There are two hundred naked Shaido prisoners from DW (can we use this acronym or is there a better one?). Aram seems to be wanting to kill absolutely anyone. Two dozen captive Aes Sedai by Asha'man. Even more Warders under guard. Loial comes up and points out how tense everything is and Perrin heads north on Stepper to join Rand. Okay, maybe I'm hyped off the end of LOC but I'm ready for some action lol.</p>

<h2>Ch 2, The Butcher's Yard, Ravens</h2>
<p><strong>Perrin.</strong> Yeesh. Nineteen Two Rivers men, a hundred Mayeners, more Cairhienin, a thousand Aiel: dead at DW. Ouch. Rand knows every name of every Maiden that died. Ouch. Holy smokes, the Rand needing Healing and picks Alanna out... whoa, that was awesome! So cool to see Rand using that bond against Alanna, since she forced it on him. Wow! I really want to talk about Taim, but first, the Wise Ones will watch the Aes Sedai prisoners, nice. To jump to Taim's viewing: Taim has blood in his past and blood in his future, he's a dangerous man. Dashiva (an Asha'man that Rand chose personally to guard Rand) calls Taim M'Hael ("leader" in the Old Tongue), and he explains it as he's been reading a lot on the farm. Hmm. I have a funny feeling about Taim. I can't place it, and I think it's just because I want him to be more submissive to Rand, yes he does submit but after argument and disaggreements. I just want Rand and Taim to connect better. Okay, reading on. </p>

<h2>Ch 3, Hills of the Golden Dawn, Flame of Tar Valon</h2>
<p><strong>Perrin.</strong> Oh heck. So, Dashiva is awkward and doesn't know "one end of a sword from the other". Rand trusts Perrin, Min, and Loial. So, since Rand has been gone... 10 days? or more? 16 days? and Colavaere has been crowned in Cairhien. Wow, how?! Berelain just stepped aside? Also, there have been some bubbles of evil killing people. And there are ten Aes Sedai are in the city staying with Arilyn Dhulaine. This scout Wise One Feraighin calls perrin sei'cair. Rand orders the Aes Sedai to be taken to the Aiel tents. Perrin wants to know about Faile and Bain and Chiad aren't with Faile any longer. Loial says he would worry about Erith too. Rand and crew are heading to Cairhien. Oh boy.</p>

<h2>Ch 4, Into Cairhien, Cairhien Sun</h2>
<p><strong>Perrin.</strong> My son loves to say "that was happy for me" when he sees a city bus or an airplane or an excavator... and that's how I feel when I read any of RJ's descriptions of places... "that was happy for me"! Okay, this was a fine chapter... lol. Still on Perrin, that's... fine. lol. This Dashiva fella... I can't pinpoint how I feel about him, or Taim for that matter. I also love the magic system in the fact that to Gateway you have *know* the place well enough to Gateway.. that's cool! Perrin learns that Faile is one of Colavaere's attendants.. hmm. </p>

<h2>Ch 5, A Broken Crow, Dragon</h2>
<p><strong>Perrin.</strong> So we meet Colavaere. Faile is there too! Rand confronts Colavaere and Rand takes her crown and breaks it then fixes it.. "what is done can be undone" he says. Perrin accuses her of murder (Maringil and Meilan) and asks about Berelain (silly Perrin, not in front of Faile..). Colavaere has Annoura Larisen, a Gray and an advisor to Berelain with her, but Jahar (Asha'man) shields her. Berelain hired thief-catchers who traced the murders to Colavaere. Also let it slip that the Aes Sedai promised her that Rand wouldn't return.... Dobraine comes up and announces Rand's penalty for murder is hanging. Now here is where it gets interesting. Min looks sad at this announcment. Rand then can't bring himself to have her executed, so he has her titles striped and exiles her to her smallest farm. Now, I find that very interesting. How are the Aiel going to take that after what happened to Mangin, he was hanged because of his murder... Hmm. I don't know why Rand is doing this. I really hope it doesn't have to do with Min being sad about this. Hmm. And Rand wants to be taken to Berelain. </p>

<h2>Ch 6, Old Fear, and New Fear, Wolf</h2>
<p><strong>Perrin.</strong> How-dy! There you go Perrin, that's what Faile wanted! Pick her up and tell her how it is. Okay, so we get that Faile suggests killing Colavaere and Dobraine refuses. Faile and Perrin nearly got some sexy time, then Rand stomps in lol. That was funny. So, this Perrin.. "*I* won't let you kill the Aes Sedai". WHOA. HMM. Okay, so Berelain is staying on a Sea Folk ship for some reason. Rand seems to be *pausing to listen* to someone.. Rand wants Perrin to command the army against Illian, Perrin says no. Rand wants Perrin to be elsewhere in a day or two. </p>

<h2>Ch 7, Pitfalls and Tripwires, Caemlyn Lion</h2>
<p><strong>Rand.</strong> Yes! A Rand perspective. Alright, here we go. So Rand was looking for the fat-man angreal within the wagons! Oh no! He doesn't have that anymore! Will he go to Rhuidean to get the angreal, or was it ter'angreal in the wall?? Probably not, that'd be too easy. Hey, what's going on in Rhuidean?? Okay, so Rand wants to know what saidin would be like cleansed?! Oh oh oh!! So, things have been happening while Rand was *away*. Also, I love when Rand tells the Asha'man to “release” saidin and they do and he thinks “good soldiers”. Whoa. I'm scared if they turn on him. Oh boy. Rand really wants Elayne and Aviendha to be in Caemlyn, yet they're not.. they're in Ebou Dar! Rand is going to leave Fedwin (strongest Asha'man of the eight here) as a secret messenger. Rand wants to send troops tonight.. to Illian?! Is it starting now?!</p>

<h2>Ch 8, The Figurehead, Forsnaken</h2>
<p><strong>Egwene.</strong> Woo, and Egwene perspective! Okay, so reading this chapter, I had to stop reading and wonder... was this a retcon - the fact that Mogi was still attached to the a'dam... and then she had the a'dam necklace removed. Got it. Okay, cople of things here. Bryne's army is thirty thousand. Logain has escaped.. (from Egwene's plan.. right?). Egwene is getting another headache... interesting. Siuan was chosen Amyrlin very young because the previous three each died after just a few years.. interesting. DSheriam notices the bracelet that Egwene wears and tells her it was a gift from Elayne and Nynaeve. Egwene asks Sheriam about the ten sisters that were sent to Tar Valon (two each ajah besides Blue). Ah Forsaken counts! Dead: Asmo, Ravin, Ishamaael, Be'lal. Aginor and Balthamel (... not anymore). Demandred, Sammael, Graendal, Masaana, Semirage, (definitely spelling these wrong on purpose ;)). Neat!</p>

<h2>Ch 9, A Pair of Silverspike, Flame of Tar Avalon</h2>
<p><strong>Egwene.</strong> This chapter felt a little long to me. I kept thinking, yeah we know this already, I'm ready for something to happen. Not like an action scene or anything. But nothing really happened. This is about the only thing I thought of that I found interesting. Egwene thinks that now she can pass on more of Moghedien's secrets: weaving disguises, cloaking ability to channel. They already passed on Traveling. She tells Leane to tell Faolain and Theodrin to ask around camp if anyone has seen a strange man… Aran'gar (Balthamel). Also Egwene learned to Skim from Mogi. The Salidar Aes Sedai have a Gateway space in each camp they build. And Nicola and Ariena try to blackmail Egwene. Egwene can't go to Rand because of Tower Law. Did I miss anything? </p>

<h2>Ch 10, Unseen Eyes, TAR</h2>
<p><strong>Egwene.</strong> I want to jump to Callandor. WHO IS GOING TO PICK IT UP AND FOLLOW RAND WHEN THEY PICK IT UP?!?! Could it be a Male Forsaken, or now we have the Asha'man - that technically follow Rand... but maybe they follow Taim more than Rand??? Okay, that's all on Callandor. I am concerned. I am concerned with all these "unseen eyes" watching Egwene. Someone literally outside her tent, then the people in the Stone of Tear.. goodness, stop going to the same place for these meetings. Egwene thinks her mother Marin would let her marry Gawyn, nice! Ogier stedding can't be entered in TAR. Logain is going to the Black Tower... sweet! I look forward to that! </p>

<p>And dreams! Egwene interpreted one of her own dreams of Gawyn becoming her Warder.. nice! Dreaming and Dreamwalking have nothing to do with the One Power - that's interesting and cool! Like Min's viewings! I wonder if other people have that ability? Gawyn dreams, a wall of seals that she cannot tear down... I do wonder if there are just a stockpile of fake seals, maybe. Mat grabs an illuminator's firework and doesn't die, but men *will die* because of this... whoa. Egwene's head about to be chopped. Logain laughing over Rand's dead body, oh oh, and Logain stepping onto a black stone.... the Black Tower podium?! and Rand's face is like a puppet. Hawk (berelain) with man dying (perrin, I guess). Dark young man holds a brightly shining object (callendor).</p>

<h2>Ch 11, An Oath, Women</h2>
<p><strong>Egwene.</strong> Faolain chose Blue. Theodrin chose Brown. They spoke to people and they say they saw Halima outside Mogi's tent. Siuan has been in TAR looking for Mogi and finds nothing. Siuan still wants to be the head of eyes and ears of Blue. Lelaine and Romanda complain that Delana wants Elaida declared as Black Ajah. Egwene says no. Egwene goes with Siuan, Myrelle, and Bryne to something that Bryne wants Egwene to see. </p>

<h2>Ch 12, A Morning of Victory, Forsnaken</h2>
<p><strong>Egwene.</strong> This was a long chapter. I'm **very** interested in this Halima / Egwene relationship. It seems Egwene has no worry towards Halima. Also, headaches began the day after Logain escaped, the first time she talked to Halima... What could Halima be doing to Egwene?? Halima (Aran'gar - Balthamel). LAN! Whoa, Lan is going to be in Ebou Dar with Nynaeve, yes yes yes! That's great! I look forward to seeing that play out. I'm also loving Egwene going at these Aes Sedai because she *is* the Amyrlin.. whoa, awesome! I do appreciate that Moiriane and Myrelle spoke and Myrelle was going to pass the bond to Nynaeve, good. Mat's army is growing to ten thousand, a similar number to Bryne's army, and Bryne's army is **for Egwene**. That's great! Right? Alright, reading on!</p>

<h2>Ch 13, The Bowl of the Winds, SeaFolk</h2>
<p><strong>Aviendha.</strong> SEA FOLK SEA FOLK! Oh wow, I love the Sea Folk. A little sketchy, but I want to know so much more about them. Also, Aviendha is having a world of trouble with all this water around.. lol. Also, aslo, this Bowl of the Winds seems like it is going to take a **loooong time** to find. I'm interested in Elayne and Aviendha adopting each other as first-sisters. Rand was Aivendha's first lover, wink. Come on girls, just have Mat help you all. Sea Folk!</p>

<h2>Ch 14, White Plumes, Dice</h2>
<p><strong>Mat.</strong> Go Olver! Okay, so Mat sees the woman who tried to kill Rand and Mat from TEOTW?! WHOA! What a callback! Okay, Mat also sees a white haired old man with a hooked nose. Mat has lost a lot of memories that have been filled, I feel like he's close to remembering Birgitte... lol, hopefully. Mat stops at a ring shop while following this woman, and the ring doesn't come off until Mat pays for it... should I pay attention to this ring?? HMM. And this Palace is Jaichim Carridin's Palace, at least I assume that is what "let to Jaichim Carridin" means. Whoa. Then the white haired man is gone.... spooky. Dice rolling in Mat's head! </p>

<h2>Ch 15, Insects, Forsnaken</h2>
<p><strong>Carridin.</strong> Carridin still thinks Niall is alive... and this White Plumes woman is Mili Skane a saddler's daughter near Whitebridge. She went to the White Tower and couldn't learn so she became a Friend of the Dark, her words. She's killed twenty people in seven years. She is an assassin and hunter. She leads a circle and reports to Carridin. And anoterh high Darkfriend reporting to him is a one eyed beggar named Old Cully. WHOA! SAMMAEL!! Also holy cow, this vision after seeing Mat and this Darkfriend social vision with Mat and horn and dagger and whoa! How is that possible?? Okay back to Sammael, whoa. All this about Fades and Trollocs and how they eat and kill people... dark. And oh no, Carridin's sister Vanora. Sammael is going to send... *someone* to deal with Nynaeve, Elayne, and Aviendha. Carridin asked a favor of Sammael.. hmm. Carridin's whole family is dead now.. and WHOA DOES CARRIDIN RIP IT TO SHIAINE! Also, Sammael opens a gateway to a place with gray columns and mist.. Illian right? Shiaine wakes and calls Carridin Bors and he wants her to put all her efforts in finding Mat. He has other darkfriends looking for the stash of angreal, ter'angreal, and sa'angreal. This turned out to be a good chapter.</p>

<h2>Ch 16, A Touch of the Cheek, Flame of Tar Valon</h2>
<p><strong>Mat.</strong> Whoa! Mat has gotten himself into something.. whoa. Mat goes into the Tarasin Palace and he gets passed around all these people to get up to see Nynave and Elayne or send them a message. Then Joline and Teslyn catch up to him (Elaida's), and they really want Mat because he's ta'veren. There are nine Aes Sedai in the palace, Nynaeve, Elayne, Joline, Teslyn, Adeleas, Vandene, Merilille, Sareitha, and one more. Then Joline, Teslyn, Addeleas, Sareitha, and Merilille argue over Mat. Then Laren reappears from a summons to Queen Tylin to Mat. Mat enters and speaks Old Tongue. Mat writes a note to the girls about Darkfriends and Carridin and seals it with his new ring! The Ring is engraved with a border of large crescents and a running fox that seemed to have startled two birds in flight! Nice! Lucky Mat picked up that ring because that's so important to Mat... ta'veren! Tylin doesn't react Carridin being a darkfriend. Tylin really **wants** Mat.. whoa. whoa! Then Tylin's son comes in, Beslan, and Tylin wants him to befriend Mat and go to some festivals in Ebou Dar. Whoa!</p>

<h2>Ch 17, The Triumph of Logic, Woman</h2>
<p><strong>Mat.</strong> OH OH! Multiple perspectives! Mat is in the Wandering Woman, and Mat orders Vanin to check out the Chelsaine Palace. There is a report of a bubble of evil fog in Rahand that mangled people. A serving girl says an Illuminator is looking for Mat. While, Mat is also looking for an Illuminator... Aludra! Mat goes upstairs and is attacked by two men, quickly killed by Mat. Setalle and Jasfer Anan say the men checed in with a big chest and they said they were on their way to Nor Chasen. Mat's dice haven't stopped yet. Mat finds a note in his pocket and it says "Elayne and Nynaeve are pushing too far. They are still in danger from the Tower. Warn them to be careful, or they will be kneeling to Elaida." - it is written on fine snowy white paper. Mat thinks it was Joline and Teslyn to leave the note.... MY GUESS it was Vandene? no... maybe! Next perspective!</p>

<p><strong>Joline.</strong> I love this.. the only hope against the Dark One is a boy who is running wild... hah Rand! Joline is loyal to the White Tower, not Elaida. Teslyn says Elaida called Joline a child. Joline is upset because she is older than Elaida's mother. Teslyn wants to take Elayne, Nynaeve, Mat, and Aviendha to Elaida. Joline wants to depose Elaida too. </p>

<p><strong>Falion.</strong> Whoa! YEESH, Falion is with Ispan of the Blue Ajah.. but they're BLACK AJAH! They're looking for this cache of angreal, ter'angreal, and sa'angreal... just like the other Forsaken. UH OH! Falion is White Ajah.. cough, black ajah. Callie a Wise Woman was kicked out of the White Tower four years ago and tried to steal a ter'angreal to make flowers and the sound of a waterfall. Mogi hasn't talked to Falion in a while, not even in TAR. Falion suggests kidnapping Nynaeve and Elayne. Ispan wants to kill them. WHOA!</p>

<p>WHO WAS THAT? Was this that Old Cully? This person was near where where Falion and Ispan are staying and then Arnin and Nad (the guys who were disposing of the body from Falion's perspective) walk out with a wheel barrow. He can't remember a lot, but his head hurts and he can't remember much. </p>

<h2>Ch 18, As the Plow Breaks the Earth, Dragon</h2>
<p><h2>Rand.</h2> Whoa! I keep saying that, because I really have no idea where this book is going and whoa - things happen so quick! Rand is in Cairhien with some clan chiefs and he has Merana warded off as a demonstration for the clan chiefs serving them tea... she is sworn to Rand, whoa! So Berelain comes in and Rand is sending Berelain back to Mayene, and going to put Dobraine to run Cairhien. Rand is also **very** important to Sea Folk prphecies but they won't say how. Rand sees swirling colors... a vision? or something, I don't know. Okay now we get Cadsuane and she freaks Rand out because she comes in and Merana literally runs out of the ward and yells at her not to harm Rand, of course he is going to be scared. Everyone veils and the boys seize saidin and then nothing happens. Cadsuane is a Green Ajah, and literally one of the oldest living Aes Sedai and she knows a lot! She has faced more men who can channel than any four Red Ajah, but she doesn't hunt them she just *has the nose for it*. She asks Rand if he is hearing voices yet, and she says voices are part of the taint madness.... oh oh!! SHOCKING NEWS! Dashiva laughs, Lews Therin leaves Rand's head for the moment. Cadsuane asks if she can consult with Annoura and Merana and they leave. Rand wonders if LTT is real or he is going mad... and.... I just don't know. Rand has a lot of LTT's memories. But maybe it's just because Rand is LTT's soul?? Oh, I just don't know. I think I really want LTT to be real, and I eventually want them to be able to communicate more fully. BUT, what happens when saidin is cleaned of the taint?? OH I JUST DON'T KNOW! Hey, good chapter!</p>

<h2>Ch 19, Diamonds and Stars, Flame of Tar Valon</h2>
<p><strong>Merana.</strong> Hey, this Cadsuane is no joke. Cadsuane helped capture both Logain and Taim... hmmmmmm. Cadsuane asks Merana and Annoura if they were involed in the "vileness" after the Aiel War, the Grand Coalition, and Merana has no idea what that is. Cadsuane is old, btw. Retired twice. Old. Cadsuane asks a bunch of questions, about Forsaken being loose, about Rand's kidnapping, Alanna bonding Rand, about Berelain's letters to Annoura. Merana is worried about their oath to Rand and how it will effect their relationship with other Aes Sedai.</p>

<p><strong>Min.</strong> Well well well.... And then there were three. Okay, so Fel is dead (we knew that LOC Epilogue) and now Rand knows.. and then Colavere is dead by hanging! WHOA! And whoa.. okay, so Min is really interested in Fel's books nice! Maybe Min can be the Fel for Rand now. And oh oh... Min and Rand have sex! WOW! Then there were three women. Elayne, Aviendha, and Min. Now Rand just has to have sex with Elayne. wow. </p>

<p><strong>Cadsuane.</strong> 270+ years old?! HOW?! Okay, so Cadsuane was with the Aes Sedai at Arilyn's palace.. hmm. She wants to direct Rand and nothing can interfere. She think Elaida is making her job harder. She gets into a coach with the sigil of a pair of silver stars atop red and green stripes, which is Dobraine right? Since Dobraine will be leading Caihrien right? Whoa!</p>

<h2>Ch 20, Patters Within Patters, Forsnaken</h2>
<p><strong>Sevanna.</strong> It's only been TWO DAYS SINCE DUMAI'S WELLS?! Whoa. This crew is a hundred miles east of DW - Tion, Modarra, Alarys, Meira, Rhiale, Someryn, and Belinde. Less than twenty thousand Shaido spears are with them. Therave and another Wise One with Sevanna is missing. This is a call box. Caddar (Demandred?) and Maisia (Graendal?) come. Somehow Caddar can talk near this box and then they just show up, somehow. Caddar doesn't like that Sevanna has seven Wise Ones instead of one trying to use the call box. Caddar has promised something that will control Rand when he is taken but will not overcome him.. a'dam? The Wise Ones ask if they have something like that for female Aes Sedai and they say yes. She asks about Travelling and Caddar looks pleased and says he can provide travelling boxes. Caddar and Maisia leave. Why would that be Demandred? Maybe it's not Demandred. I have no idea why I thought that. </p>

<p><strong>The Watcher.</strong> Okay, I'm going to rant a bit here. THIS IS ISHAMAEL! YES YES YES! Oh, i'm so excited about this prediction. This is Ishamael. He's back! Using the **True Power** holy cow!! WOW. Okay, first off, I was wrong, the two Caddar and Maisia was Sammael and Graendal. ANyway, this is Ishamael, for sure. I am excited to learn more about this True Power, the one that Lanfear and.. someone I can't remember was trying to get/use in the Rhuidean visions. Wow. Okay, so this True Power comes straight from the Great Lord and the Watcher... Ishamael, sees black flecks in his vision. Gosh I'm just so excited about this prediction. Mesaan ahad a hand in kidnapping Rand. Graendal won't risk teaching the Wise Ones Compulsion unless Sammael has found a binder.. nice! The Watcher, Ishamael, is covered in fancloth except for his eyes so he can't be seen. Graendal hates the name Maisia. Sammael opens a Gateway, and eventually Graendal follows. The Watcher feels the prickling of saidar end and smiles crookedly. He decides not to kill the eight women. AND RIPS A HOLE IN THE PATTERN WITH THE TRUE POWER AND STEPS OUTSIDE THE PATTERN. HO-LY CRAP! Ishamael. Ishamael. Also more and more predictions. Ishamael will be Nae'blis. Ishamael is the Lord of Chaos. Ishamael. YES YES YES!</p>

<p>Why do I think that? Honestly, I think this only because we've gotten Osan'gar and Aran'gar come back, so now we know that Forsaken can come back. But this True Power thing has me feeling Ishamael. It was a feeling I got with how knowledgable the Water seemed with the world and Sammi and Graendi. And how excited he was to use the True Power. And his skin prickled when Graendi channeled. And this person is clearly from AOL and at least super knowledgeable with saidin and the Pattern to be able to step outside. And I am just begging for Ishi to come back.. lol </p>

<h2>Ch 21, A Swovan Night, Dice</h2>
<p><strong>Mat.</strong> Oh this book is picking up! RJ writes like I've never read before.. Wow. This is book 7. So we've read every word of six books before. And now we get the callback from BOOK TWO and ohhhhh chills! Mat knows Birgitte is Birgitte! I'm pumped about this duo. They are going to be so much fun to be together. I'm jumping ahead.. Mat was attacked and was almost kidnapped by some "beggers", he killed them. Mat sees fireworks and is trying to find an Illuminator (Alludra is who I'm holding out hope for - because that's the only Illuminator we know lol). Nalesean, Harnan, and Vanin aren't in the Wandering Woman. I love how Birgitte and Mat communiacte with each other, and Birgitte say sthat Mat's accent changes from an Eharoni High Prince to a First Lord of Manetheren and then they remember Tovans from a thousand years ago. They promise to keep each other's secret and they go down to have a drink. Mat thinks "Birgitte is the key!". YES YES YES A Crown of Swords is picking up!</p>

<p><strong>Nynaeve.</strong> Uh oh. I'm losing my Nynaeve love here. Come on Nynaeve, all Mat wants is an apology for the Stone of Tear! That's it! Oh Nynaeve, please. Anyway, they're back from the Sea Folk ship and Nynaeve's weather sense is saying there is a bad storm coming. Elayne  is acting drunk, and it's because of her bond with Birgitte.. haha that's hilarious! Come on Nynaeve. </p>

<h2>Ch 22, Small Sacrifices, Flame of Tar Valon</h2>
<p><strong>Elayne.</strong> What the heck is going on? The Circle? Reanne Corly? I'm jumping ahead. So, Elayne and Nynaeve apologize and promise not to belittle Mat or give him orders and to listen to his advice. Mat grabs his head and mumbles about the dice. They tell him about the Bowl of the Winds and that it is in the Rahad. They ask Mat to move to the Palace and he agrees. He then mutters that the dice have stopped. Mat refuses Healing. Elayne is still fascinated by the foxhead medallion. Aviendha and Birgitte wen to watch Carridin in Illusion disguises. Then Setalle Anan grabs Nynaeve and Elayne and takes them to a room and starts berating them about being Aes Sedai. I'm so confused. I guess Anan is a darkfriend and this Reanne is a Black Ajah? Elayne and Nynaeve are about to be in some deep water if they continue to this Reanne person. There are at least fifty Aes Sedai in this Circle. Also, Anan likes Mat lol. What is going on?</p> 

<h2>Ch 23, Next Door to a Weaver, Wheel and Snake</h2>
<p><strong>Nynaeve.</strong> Again, what is going on?? What was the point in all this? Setalle took them here and now they're just let go? Lets see if any of this is important after this. Otherwise, I feel we may never find this Bowl. So Satelle brings them to this house, and there is at least one channeler. Then a maid brings them to Reanne. She is not as strong as Nicola but as strong as Sheriam, Kwamesa, or Kiruna and she sweats. Then Berowin, a Wise Woman, then Garenia. Setalle things Garenia looks like Zarya Alkaese. Something more is happening that we don't know about yet. Garenia asks "that was Setalle Anana, How did she.. Even after seventy years, the Tower would...". So something is happening that we have no idea about. Then Berowin shields Nynaeve and it is a HUGE shield that could hold a Forsaken apparently, because it stretches. Then they're quized on Novice things in the White Tower. Elayne is upset and demands for the angreal stash and then Nynaeve and Elayne are thrown out. Apparently there are a bunch of Wise Women who can channel and the White Tower might not know about them, t;;;;;bhat's why this *guild* is still around. Hmm.</p>

<h2>Ch 24, The Kin, Flame of Tar Valon</h2>
<p><strong>Reanne.</strong> Okay, I think I see it now. These are Wise Women who went to the White Tower but were kicked out! OH OH! Reanne wanted to be Green Ajah but panicked uring her Accepted Test. OH OH! Okay so the *Kin* heard rumors of the rebel Salidar Aes Sedai and the girl Amyrlin, and the Red Ajah setup Logain. They think the Aes Sedai don't know about the Kin. Garenia is upset that Setalle knows about the Kin. Reanne tells her Setalle learned of the Kin over twenty years ago... accidentaly when the Kin saved her life at her first childbirth. Sarainya Vostovan comes in and reports Callie is dead. That's the name that Falion talked about in chapter 17! Also Sumeko is a great Healer says that Callie was killed with the One Power.</p> 

<p><strong>Nynaeve.</strong> The Slowing. THAT IS A FREAKING COOL CONCEPT ROBERT JORDAN. HECK! Okay, this is great! Elayne, you smarty pants. Let's dive in. Elayne wonders how old the Kin are. Elin Warrel an Accepted is over forty but still looks twenty. Reanne looks fifty to sixy. Channelers *slow*. Between twenty and twenty-five they begin aging more slowly. How much depends on their strength. Takima told Elayne that slowing is the beginning of the ageless look. THAT IS SO COOL. Still doesn't tell me how old Aes Sedai are. Like, give me a straight number for Cadsuene RJ, give me it. lol. And then Nynaeve and Elayne are attacked in the street! WHOA! Elayne is knocked out but Nynaeve drives them off and then weaves a simple weave of Wind, Water, Earth, Fire and Sprit, but decides to just use Spirit, Wind, and Water and I quote, "that Yellows have used since time ememorial". WHOA! WHAT A PHRASE! Elayne wonders if this was Joline and Teslyn. Nynaeve thinks not. WHOA!</p>

<h2>Ch 25, Mindtrap, Forsnaken</h2>
<p><strong>Moghedien.</strong> First off, Ishamael. That's him. That's got to be Moridin. Got. To. Be! Okay, this was absolutely insane. Mogi is having a recurring dream of her Pit of Doom experience. Shaidar Haran meets her and leads her to the Pit of Doom. The Dark One is MAD because she was teaching his enemies and she is fitted with a mindtrap (cour'souvra - OT). THis can only be done at Shayol Ghul (That's incredibly awesome and terrifying) and only to those who can channel. She screams for mercy from the Dark One. Then she wakes up to Shaidar Haran and keeps calling him Mia'cova (My Owner), and whoa SCARY. He holds her mindtrap. He makes her close her eyes and she thinks she is being thrown through a wall and ends up in a room with a young man who calls himself Moridin. Strng chin with bright blue eyes and tall and broad shouldered. He is the same size as Rand (ISHAMAEL - I AM CALLING IT). ANd has saa which indicates use of the True Power, and apparenlty there have only been twenty-nine others that have been given the privilege of useing that power. Hmm. He tells her she has been in a vacuole, but only two days of real time and she feels as if there are bands of cuande about her chest.. no idea what that is. Time flows differently in the vacuole, even Mesaana doesn't understand vacuoles completely. They can be very dangerous. They could also break away from the Pattern and be lost forever. Moridin (Ishamael - me, I am calling it) now has her mindtrap and has another's mindtrap as well.</p> 

<p>Okay, first off, whoa, but second off, I LOVE THIS TRUE POWER. This adds such another dimention, not including the literal other dimention of this vacuole thing, but like whoa. TOUCHING THE DARK ONE'S POWER. AHHHHHHHH SO COOL!</p>

<h2>Ch 26, The Irrevocable Words, Whitecloak Sunburst</h2>
<p><strong>Morgase.</strong> So you mean to tell me that the Queen of Andor can whisper to herself that she is no longer queen and then she isn't the Queen anymore? I find that very hard to believe. People will continue calling her Queen Morgase and she'll say.. "oh but I whispered to myself - so I'm not queen anymore". Odd. Anyways, THIS WAS AWESOME! Seanchan INVASION! Also, a pretty horrible chapter.. Morgase had to give herself to Valda after Asunawa worked on her for an hour.. gross. Skipping past that. The Seanchan come to get Morgase and they pass a "der'sul'dam", we haven't heard that before right? and their damane. Suroth is there! High Lady Suroth, leader of Those Who Come Before who succors the Return! Panels depicting a bird of prey and a large cat decorate Niall's old chamber. Surroth has a lopar named ALmandaragal. She is attended by Alwhin, Pura, and Jinjin. Pura used to be Aes Sedai. Surroth orders Thera to dance, she is Amathera from Tarabon. Seanchan have taken Tarabon and are now taking Amadicia.</p> 

<p>Morgase is escorted back to her rooms where she considers umping out of the window and then abdicates her throne to Elayne (this has been done twice before in the history of Andor). The men return with Balwer, and Morgase decides escape is better than death. THey kill the guards and leave with the passes Balwer obtained. They head east. All said the Seanchan oath: obey, wait, and serve.</p>

<p>I have a question! Artur Hawkwing. Seanchan. Artur Hawkwing was a hero of the horn, strong ta'veren. Tried to take the White Tower.. did a lot of things. And the Seanchan are terrible. Are we supposed to be rooting for the Seanchan to take over the world because Artur Hawkwing is a Hero of the Horn? Should we hate the Seanchan? Should we hate Hawkwing?</p>

<h2>Ch 27, To Be Alone, Wolf</h2>
<p><strong>Perrin.</strong> Gosh, Rand threw Perrin across the room with the One Power. WHOA RAND! This was more about the Aes Sedai treatment. Perrin, may need to back off that train.. And okay. Rand tells Perrin he never wants to see him again and to get out of Cairhien. Loial and Karldin are going to visit the stedding and Loial wants Perrin and Faile to come with them, but Perrin declines. Perrin meets with Faile, Aram, Bain, Chiad, Suilin, and a dozen more Maidens. Selande, Camail, another woman, and three men too. They are apart of Selande's "society"... great lol. A Cairhienin with a "society", I don't see *any problems with the Aiel with that*. More Maidens, Two Rivers men, Gaul, Jur Grady, Fager Neald, six Wise Ones including Edarra and two Aes Sedai, Seonid (green) and Masuri (brown). A gateway is made (we don't know where to yet), Dannil leads the Two Rivers men, then two dozen Cairhienin and Tairens comes also. Grady tells Perrin about his wife, Sora. Apparently the Asha'man have been bonding their wives?! WHAT?! An Asha'man named Canler figured out how and taught the others. Taim was angry about them figuing things out on their own... uh oh. Berelain also comes with Nurelle, Bertain Gallenne and more than nine hundred Winged Guards. Perrin tells them they are in Ghealdan.. oh. And they are going to convince Queen Alliandre (Berelain is) that they aren't invading, and then they are to bring back Masema and his followers to Rand. </p>

<p>Man, the more I heard of the bits and pieces of the Asha'man, I am scared. What is going on over there?! They are getting super powered and it is going ot be BAD! I want it to be good for Rand and crew, but they just keep doing things that are shady and I'm worried.</p> 

<h2>Ch 28, Bread and Cheese, Dice</h2>
<p><strong>Mat.</strong> What are these dice in Mat's head, why do they role?? I MUST KNOW! I am happy to RAFO. Okay , so Mat is about to move into the Palace and when Elayne mentions the Palace rooms - the dice top rolling. Tylin literally molests Mat, whoa! Elayne and Nynaeve come back - because they were gone (the Wise Women house), and Mat assigns them bodyguards and they send him to watch the Kin house from a tavern across the street, the Rose of the Eldar. I love theym using Mat because "you're ta'veren, just sit there something is bound to happen". HAHA! Also, I love RJ writing little things about the "scrawny innkeeper" we know they're a darkfriend because of that writing! then the "moving too fast for his age" thing about Old Cully... who is Old Cully! Mat likes Birgitte as a friend. Juilin learns that Carridin purchased the plans to the Tarasin Palace. The next morning is the day of the FEstival of Birds and the dice are rolling again. Something is going to happen!!</p>

<h2>Ch 29, The Festival of Birds, Saidin / Dragon Fang</h2>
<p><strong>Mat.</strong> I feel this book will rank as a "Good Wheel of Time Book" for me. I do scores after I finish books, and around this point in books or sometimes earlier I get stuck on a score. In my head, right now this book is about a 4/5, where all other WOT books so far have been 5/5. This is a good book, but I'm just going through it. Nothing has blown me away yet, things have been great, but I've still got a couple hundred pages left, so we'll see. Anyways... so Mat was literally raped by Tylin. Gross. Awful. I am worried about Mat, but it seems he was more concerned with the fact that *she* did it and not him. We'll see. Anyways, Mat meets with Nalesean and Birgitte and then Beslan joins with six friends, and then a group of fake beggars attack them, one named Spar who works for Old Cully. Then they go to a tavern by the Kin house and it's all talk about Mat's ta'veren. Beslan thinks Mat is good for Tylin. His father died ten years ago. ANd Mat goes away angry and says "if I don't come back tomorrow, tell them to find it themselves" - cloud bowl. Mat's dice are rolling and he goes off following a woman who leaves the Kin house.</p> 

<p><strong>Reanne.</strong> Mat's ta'veren is pulling! Solain is this woman that was leaving the Kin house. Reanne felled *compelled* - Mat's ta'veren, to send Solain this morning. Normally the order is given at the half moon, still five nights off. This is a meeting of the Twelve Elders of whom she is the Eldest. Neat!</p>

<h2>Ch 30, The First Cup, Forsnaken</h2>
<p><strong>Elayne.</strong> The Aes Sedai are mad at Elayne for endagering a two thousand year secret.. the Kin. Carridin sends a letter to Elayne that Morgase is alive and with Niall offering to take Elayne to Amador. Elayne gets upset because she thinks its a lie. Then Elayne takes over and the Aes Sedai give up a little bit lol. They then see Elayne as an equal.. sort of. Elayne is very strong in the One Power.. ranking higher than these Aes Sedai. The Kin helps runaways, and the White Tower let them. They tend to break up other groups like the Daughters of Silence but that was two hundred years ago twenty three channelers led by two former Accepted. Apparently Elayne has some of her own info about the Kin..</p>

<p><strong>Mogi.</strong> Oh oh, Mogi is in Ebou Dar. She spots, I'm guessing Nynaeve, and after some Compulsion (which Mogi isn't the best at, only good at) she tries to balefire Nynaeve's boat, but pigeons startle her (HAHA) and she accidentally cuts the boat in half instead of destroying the cabin. Also, Moridin's colors are black and red.. (ISHAMAEL - my guess, still). She hopes Moridin might forgive or ignore her independent action and she heads back for Falion and Ispan. </p>

<h2>Ch 31, Mashiara, Wheel and Snake</h2>
<p><strong>Nynaeve.</strong> BLOCK BROKEN! All it took was nearly dying by drowning lol. But it's broken!! WOOOOOOOO! And, Lan is here! Nynaeve is going to marry and bond Lan, that's awesome! She realizes the attack was Mogi. She's still on her way to the Sea Folk and she plans to get married ASAP! WOO! </p>

<p><strong>Elayne.</strong> Reanne is 411 years old!!!!!! AHHHHHH I'M SCREAMING! That is insane! How, oh my wow. This is amazing!!!!! Okay, this is an awesome end to this chapter. I'm hyped up now y'all, where's my 4/5 gone lol. Okay, Elayne, Merilille, Vandene, Adeleas, Sareitha, Careane, and Birgitte bust into the Kin house. Love this red belt Wise Women thing. I can't wait to start a re-read and see where all these red belts have been the whole time. Okay, there 1783 KIN! GOOD GRACIOUS! SO MANY! Twice as many as there are Aes Sedai, that's crazy! What a chapter lol. Mat also busts in because he saw Warder's across the street. He found the six story buidling.. wait. Who said six floors.. Nynaeve or Elayne? I looked back, Nynaeve said five story lol. WHOA! AWESOME! </p>

<h2>Ch 32, Sealed to the Flame, Flame of Tar Valon</h2>
<p><strong>Elaida.</strong> Man this head of the Black Ajah as Keeper is not going to be good for Elaida. Yeesh. Twelve out of thirty nine Aes Sedai have returned with Gawyn and the Younglings. Elaida meant for Galina to have killed Gawyn. The guards won't let Gawyn or the Younglings enter Tar Valon. Elaida order the retured Aes Sedai to stay out of sight in a village, Dorlan. Covarla told Elaida the news. Elaida learns there were hundreds of Asha'man. Toveine and her fifty Aes Sedai will be trapped. Rand and the Asha'man might even come to the White Tower for revenge. Alviarin takes over and tells Elaida she will be deposed and stilled if Elaida doesn't obey Alviarin. Alviarin orders Elaida to abandon Galina and Toveine and to order an increase in the Tower Guard. And to search rooms of Josaine and Adelorna (green) for stashed angreal and to give them severe punishments. And then to praise Doraise, Kiyoshi, and Ferellien of Brown, Gray and Yellow and give them presents. Elaida agrees and Elaids thinks of a way to get rid of Alviarin.</p>

<p><strong>Alviarin.</strong> Worried about Elaida finding out that she held out info for days, five different ajahs gave her info about Cairhien and Mesanna told her about events at DW. She thinks Elaida will suffer Siuan's fate lacking a miacle such as the rebels appearing at the gates.</p>

<p><strong>Seaine.</strong> Whoa, this was a lot lol. Okay, so Seaine a Sitter for the White Ajah - all her family is dead. Not all Sitters were informed when the Hall met to raise Elaida. Of those not informed, all but Seaine left and joined the Salidar Aes Sedai. She stayed because she believes in the White Tower, not Elaida. She earned shawl the year Sereille Bagand was raised Amyrlin. Elaida asks Seaine (Sealed to the Flame) to look for Black Ajah. Seaine goes to talk with Pevara (Sitter for the Red Ajah) and they decide to look over reports from the last few months to look for lies. Pevara says she has known Darkfriends who killed their families to hide their activites..... Seaine doesn't has a dead family..... interesting.</p>

<h2>Ch 33, A Bath, Dragon</h2>
<p><strong>Rand.</strong> Oh boy, oh boy. Min's viewing of Rand and another man touching and merge into one another, and one of you dies, and one doesn't. Is it LTT and Rand? That would be awesome! I think? ALso, Rand loves Min + Aviendha + Elayne. How cute. YES! RAND HAS THE TER'ANGREAL STATUES! Oh wow, the fight between Perrin and Rand was staged lol, but Rand got so angry he nearly killed him. Rand admits to hearing LTT's voice to Min. Rand wants to send Min away. They express love. Then Rand gets a bath. Rand is on his way to the Sea Folk! We are going to get some more prophesy and I can't wait! </p>

<h2>Ch 34, Ta'veren, Sea Folk</h2>
<p><strong>Rand.</strong> Turns out Mat is the Coramoor. Just kidding, Rand is the Coramoor!! That was crazy! And very easy. This Ta'veren has some good reprocusions. So, Rand is having some issues. Rand took a bunch of people with him to a ship then made a bridge of Air laced with Fire from the boat to the Sea Folk ship (AWESOME!), apparently women can make a longer bridge even if she is weaker. You can't use the One Power to fly, even the Forsaken don't know why. Rand is the Coramoor according to the Jendai Prophecy and the Sea Folk will serve Rand. Rand's ta'veren effect causes Harine to agree to serve Rand. Min says that she'll be punished for this but will eventually become the Mistress of the Ships. Rafela says she heard reports several years ago of a girl who could see things, Min is she. Merana is intrigued. Rand wants Sea Folk ships for transport and wants information from ports especially the Aryth Ocean. Ships vanis there and Rand suspects Seanchan. Dashiva is talking to himself. Rand feels claustrophobic and leaves Merana and Rafela to complete the bargain. Rand wonders why the Forsaken haven't tried to t destroy him in the Sun Palace yet. Rand is pumped and he is going back to the Sun Palace to settle with the rebels. Rand also has a new horse, Tai'daisha (LORD OF GLORY). I'm excited to learn more about Sea Follk!</p>

<h2>Ch 35, Into the Woods, Dragon's Fang</h2>
<p><strong>Min.</strong> Oh heck. FAIN! I'm worried about Rand here, he is going to get himself caught. Toram Riatin challenges Rand to practice swords and Rand aggrees. This can only go poorly. Also Cadsuane is here. Heck. A few Aes Sedai are here. Heck. Rand and Min just went off and are now caugh up with Caraline Damodred, Moiraine's cousin (right?). Also, Min's viewing: Rand will almost certainly fail without a woman who is dead and gone.. .GOT TO BE MOIRAINE! Rand then is hunting for a coat in his cabinet and gets his green coat from DW. Rand is super ta'veren and it is pulling a lot. Another viewing, Darlin will wear a crown - simple golden circlet with a slightly curved sword on its side above his brows. Not sure what country. FAIN! This is going to be bad for Rand, I just know it will. </p>

<h2>Ch 36, Blades, Dagger</h2>
<p><strong>Min.</strong> FAIN! Oh heck, so we've got this thick cold fog that is killing people, bubble of evil? That's crazy! Rand is fighting with Toram (practice swords), when the fog comes and distracts Rand and Rand gets hit on his Balzamon scar (OUCH!). Caraline warns Rand there are seven Aes Sedai four red, and they are on their way to Tar Valon. Anyways, Fog starts and Cadsuane is with Samitsu (yellow apparently the best at Healing) and Niande (gray). Rand balefires into the fog, Cadsuane slaps Rand and tells him not to balefire again - he tells her LTT is real. Fain leaps out of the fog and slices Rand in his Balzamon scar with the Dagger from Shadar Logoth!! OH NO! Fain runs off, Cadsuane tries to Heal Rand and she is not very good at it. Samitsu says the old scar and new wound are both full of evil but different kinds. She is the **best Healer of all Aes Sedai**, she hasn't met Nynaeve yet ;). They get a ride to the Sun Palace, Cadsuane says to Rand in his uncocious state, "Do not be afraid, boy. They made my task harder, and yours, but I will not hurt you more than I must." In the Sun Palace Caraline and Darlin disappear. Rand is put in bed, then AMys comes, and Dashiva, Flinn, and Narishma. Dashiva calls for Flinn. Dashiva makes guttural sound and Flinn asks if he sees something. Dashiva says he has no Talent for Healing; he just suggested that Flinn learn. Dashiva says, "If he dies. . . ," talks to himself and makes a sound half sob half bitter laugh. Flinn is good at Healing, he was in the Queen's Guard for forty years. the M'Hael (Taim) taught him Healing a rough kind that hurts. Flinn Heals Rand. He didn't cure him but sealed the two evils and thinks maybe they will kill off each other. Samitsu is astounded and wants Flinn to teach her. Cadsuane, Amys, and Dashiva all have unreadable auras. Min gets in bed with Rand.</p>

<h2>Ch 37, A Note from the Palace, Dice</h2>
<p><strong>Mat.</strong> I. LOVE. THIS. AND. I. HATE. THIS. I love: Nynaeve and Lan - I love the way Lan reaches for his sword when Mat talked about these bloody women. I hate: Tylin for Mat. How long is this going to go. How is this even going to play out?! So, this crew are preparing to go after the Bowl of the Winds. Mat has his spear, an ashandarei according to Birgitte. The Kin is actually the Knitting Circle members as Elders. Tylin is moving Mat into her apartments. Nynaeve came back with a dozen Sea Folk. That's who married Nynave and Lan with their unusual marriage customs. Lan tells Mat that Mogi is after Nynaeve. Not much left in this book, is the bowl going to be found?? Probably. Used? Probably not.</p>

<h2>Ch 38, Six Stories, Darkfriend Women</h2>
<p><strong>Mat.</strong> WE HAVE IT! WE HAVE THE BOWL OF THE WINDS! Okay, I'm jumping ahead. A cold wind is coming up - that's interesting. The crew is on a boat to the Rahad, they arrive, Mat offers Elayne the foxhead medallion and she makes him keep it. Elayne says Nynaeve feels a storm coming and she does not mean the wind. They all arrive at the six story house. Falion and Ispan enter with two dozen men and shield Nynaeve. Lan knocks them down and a fight starts. Nynaeve is no longer shielded. Elayne screams upstairs and Mat runs up. Something / Someone is fighting and Janira's neck is broken. Nalesean comes up and then gets his throat ripped out. OH MY GOSH! Mat has been thrown across the room. Mat gets up and his medalion touches the face of this thing and it burns it. Mat stabs it mutiple times but no blood on knife. It tells Mat, "he wants you dead as much as he wants her". Mat catches the dagger that was thrown at him. Mat runs at the thing and he's waving his medallion at it. It retreats into a side room and disappears. Elayne thanks Mat for saving her and apologizes again. Nynaeve comes upstairs and starts to Heal Tamarla. Sumeko heals Reanne and uses the type of healing Nynaeve uses. Ieine is shielding Ispan. Beslan is still alive. Two Kin and siz Redarms are dead. Elayne finds the Bowl of the Winds and lots of other things that they start carrying out!</p>

<h2>Ch 39, Promises to Keep, Dice</h2>
<p><strong>Mat.</strong> Mat just had a building fall on him. Whoa. So, Olver is missing, Mat is running to find him. Seanchan have invaded Ebou Dar. WhoA! Mat and his ta'veren got the Sea Folk to go to the farm on the other side of the river. THE THING IN THE LAST CHAPTER WAS A GHOLAM! They can sense the ability to channel at fifty paces, they are immune to the One Power and have no bones. There were only three male and three female made. This one probably survived in a statis box and was sent by a Forsaken. WHOA!</p>

<h2>Ch 40, Spears, Aiel</h2>
<p><strong>Galina.</strong> It has only been NINE DAYS?! THIS BOOK HAS BEEN NINE DAYS?! That's crazy. Anyway Galina is the *despised one*, da'tsang. Galina is second in the Black Ajah after Alviarin. She's been Aes Sedai less than ninety years, and Highest of the Red Ajah almost Twenty, and Black Ajah all but five. Galina is captive of Therava and about seventy Shaido Wise Ones. Then, Galina is put ina black robe and lead out of the tent with th efourteen Wise Ones and Sevanna. Sevanna is crazy.</p>

<p><strong>Sevanna.</strong> Here we go! So Sammael calls this "an Oath Rod" activated by Spirit. There are so many unknowns with what Sammael is telling Sevanna.. I don't know who to believe! He implies he has something that will control Rand. He mentions a binding chair for those who can't channel - he doesn't know where one is though. He says Rand bound Aes Sedai taught their Wies Ones how to Travel short distances so they can be here today. Sammael tells her the boxes use saidin and a woman must not touch it - and they must wait three days before using them again. WHAT IS GOING ON!</p> 

<p><strong>Maeric.</strong> WHAT IS GOING ON?! Maeric came through the Gateway and then it closed and now these Shaido are being attacked?! WHAT IS HAPPENING?</p>

<p><strong>Graendal.</strong> Sammael and Graendal open Gateways to Illian (SAMMI) and Arad Doman (GRANDY). Sammi says "Al'Thor isn't going after anyone. All I have to do is wait." What IS ABOUT TO HAPPEN?!</p>

<p><strong>Shaidar Haran.</strong> Again... WHAT?! See, now this is awesome. Not the fact that I have no idea what is going on, just that it is good. Like I'm so interested to learn more. SO GOOD. Okay, SH can see the residue of the gateways - he can't tell the flows apart but he can smell the difference. Other Fades cannot. He examines Sammael's bag and thinking much is happening outside the plan. He burns up a spear with black flames. He thinks that if Sammael serves chaos all is well. If not, he feels achy and weak - too long away from Shayol Ghul. He wants badly to find a way to sever that tie. He Travels with *the edge of a shadow*. WHAT?! HERE WE GO!</p>

<h2>Ch 41, A Crown of Swords, Wheel and Snake</h2>
<p><strong>Rand.</strong> First off, I re-read this a few times and Rand, most certainly, did not kill Sammael. No body, not dead! However, Rand is still King of Illian! Woo! RIP Liah.. to balefire - I appreciate that Rand put her out of her misery, while taking her out of the Pattern. Okay, let's talk! This guy with Rand in Shadar Logoth.. Rand doesn't recognize who it is, so I can't think of who it might be but they were using the True Power!! Because Rand couldn't feel saidin being drawn when balefire was used. And whoa, don't cross streams fellas. And I'm going to start from the beginning of this chapter, honestly I wasn't blown away by this ending. Kind of fell flat for me.. anyways, Merana hasn't completed the Sea Folk bargain yet.. good grief. Min views of Cadsuane: She is going to teach Rand and all Asha'man something they have to learn, but they will not like learning it from her. Okay then. Whoa, I'm a bit more negative than I thought writing this. Maybe I'll come back to writing this.... uh, I'll just say - done with A Crown of Swords, starting A Path of Daggers on Monday!</p>

<h2>My Thoughts</h2>
<p>Oh no, I struggled a bit with this book. Something that is holding this book up.. the prose and world building! Other than that.. not the best I've read so far. I tell you what, I am struggling with numbers. Does anyone care about numbers? Do you care if I like the book? Most of my reviews are 5/5 anyway, I love almost everything that I read or watch, so let's talk categories.</p>

<h2>Emotional Impact</h2>
<p>This book was an easy read, but I just wasn't as impacted emotionally to this book. It was good, some good things happened, but it is hard to come close to Rand in the box or Dumai's Wells. </p>

<h2>Characters</h2>
<p>Nothing really stands out to me about any characters in particular. But, I will say - I'm pretty interested in a few characters. Cadsuane, an old Green Ajah Aes Sedai who won't stand down. The Watcher.. who I think is Ishamael back! The Asha'man, I'm so interested in learning more about them. Rand went through a lot this book, not as much as the last book, but he has a lot on his plate. I love Lan, I'm interested in his story with Nynaeve now. My love for Nynaeve went down a bit this book, but I'm still interested in her story. Mat, always a winner for me, was raped this book. And that was hard to read. He kept trying to brush it off, but he is hurting.</p> 

<h2>Plot</h2>
<p>Hmm. Seanchan have started to invade, we got that near the end. We've got the Bowl of the Winds. Nynaeve and Lan are married and Nynaeve has broken her block! Rand and Min made love. Fain sliced Rand with the Ruby Dagger. Rand now is the King of Illian. I really don't know if Rand killed Sammael. There is a new power.. the True Power from the Dark One. Mat was raped. Elaida is looking for Black Ajah in the Tower. More people learned how to Travel. We have a Knitting Circle, an incredible number of rogue Aes Sedai Wise Women, over 1700! And Aes Sedai are really old! We meet one who is over 400 years old! Also, Loial is going to all the steddings and the Waygates.</p>

<h2>Prose</h2>
<p>Always a pleasure to read RJ's writing. Perfect. </p>

<h2>World Building</h2>
<p>BIG BIG BIG building here! TRUE POWER! A new power that is used by the Chosen who were chosen by the Dark One! Oh and a gholam is here! Seanchan are invading! HERE WE GO!</p>
