            <h2>Intro</h2>
            
            <p>This week, we’re picking up right where we left off last time: the incredible story of Jericho’s fall. </p>
            
            <p>If you weren’t here, let me quickly catch you up. In Joshua 6, God gave the Israelites a unique battle plan for conquering the fortified city of Jericho. He instructed them to march around the city for six days in silence. But on the seventh day, they were to march around it seven times, blow the ram’s horns, and give a great shout. At that moment, the walls would collapse, and the city would be theirs.</p>
            
            <p>It happened just as God said. The walls came tumbling down, and the Israelites claimed the city. However, God gave them very clear instructions about what to do—and what not to do—after the victory. </p>

            <h3>Let’s revisit these key verses from Joshua 6: (Joshua 6:17-19).</h3>

            <p>God was specific: the city and everything in it was to be destroyed, except for Rahab and her family because of her faithfulness. All valuable items—gold, silver, bronze, and iron—were set apart as holy and belonged to the Lord.</p>


            <p>Then, in verse 21, we see the execution of God’s command: “They utterly destroyed everything in the city, both man and woman, young and old, and ox, sheep, and donkey, with the edge of the sword.”</p>

            <p>That brings us to Joshua 7, where the story takes a dark turn. Despite God’s clear instructions, we’ll see how disobedience and sin creep into the camp of Israel, bringing devastating consequences. </p>
            
            <p>Today, we’re focusing on a central truth: sin causes disaster. But it’s not all doom and gloom. As Christians, we know sin is part of our fallen nature. Without a Savior, we’d all be doomed to eternal separation from God. </p>

            <p>Thankfully, the story doesn’t stop with judgment—there’s also the promise of restoration and redemption, even for sinners like us.</p>

            <p>Let’s dive into Joshua 7-8 to see how God’s justice and mercy work together.</p>


        <h2>Reading Joshua 7</h2>
        <h3>Joshua 7:1</h3>

<p>So, here we are in Joshua 7:1, and the tone has already shifted. The passage tells us that Achan, one man out of the entire nation, disobeyed God’s command by taking some of the “designated things” from Jericho. These items were meant to be destroyed or placed in the Lord’s treasury, as we saw back in 6:19. Achan was the one who violated God’s clear instructions—and now the entire nation is held accountable.</p>

<p>This brings up an important question for us: <strong>How do we know what is sin and what isn’t?</strong></p>

<p><strong>What’s your definition of sin?</strong> Think about it.</p>

<p>For me, I like to use a simple but powerful phrase: Anything that doesn’t glorify God is sin. Whether it’s an action, a thought, or even an attitude, if it doesn’t bring glory to God, it misses the mark.</p>

<p>Let’s ground this in Scripture. A verse I often turn to on sin is Romans 14:23: “For whatever does not proceed from faith is sin.”</p>

<p>This reminds us that sin isn’t just about “breaking the rules”; it’s about the heart. Actions that aren’t rooted in faith or trust in God—actions driven by fear, selfishness, or pride—are sin.</p>

<p>And I’ll be the first to admit: I’m a sinner. I sin a lot. Every day is a battle to align my thoughts and actions with God’s will. But here’s the beauty of our faith: we’re not defined by our failures. We’re defined by God’s grace and the ongoing work of sanctification in our lives.</p>

<p>So, as we continue, let’s keep this in mind: sin always has consequences, but through Christ, we have the hope of redemption.</p>

<h2>Joshua 7:2-9</h2>
<p>In verses 2-5, the Israelites face their first defeat in the Promised Land. Why? It wasn’t because of a lack of strength or numbers. It wasn’t because of a bad strategy. It was because they made a critical mistake: they didn’t consult God.</p>

<p>Think about it—this entire plan to send 3,000 men to attack Ai was their idea, not God’s. There’s no mention of Joshua seeking the Lord’s guidance or asking for direction. And the result? A humiliating defeat. Sure, only 36 men died out of 3,000, but for a nation riding high on the victory at Jericho, this loss must have been a shock. God used this moment to remind them—and us—that sin and self-reliance come with consequences.</p>

<p>Then, in verses 6-9, we see something fascinating: Joshua questions God. Let’s be honest, that might feel surprising, especially coming from someone like Joshua, who had seen God’s power firsthand. But here he is, tearing his clothes, falling face down before the ark, and essentially asking, “Why did You bring us here just to let us be defeated?”</p>

<p>Why do you think Joshua questioned God? Maybe it was frustration, confusion, or even grief. Whatever the case, Joshua’s raw honesty is something we can relate to.</p>

<p>Here’s the important thing to notice: Joshua didn’t turn away from God in his doubt—he brought his questions directly to Him. That’s a lesson for us. It’s okay to wrestle with God in prayer. It’s okay to ask hard questions. What matters is that we bring our doubts and struggles to Him, trusting that He can handle them.</p>

<h3>Two key points:</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Self-reliance without seeking God’s guidance leads to failure.</li>
    <li>When we’re confused or frustrated, we should run toward God, not away from Him.</li>
</ul>

<p>Let’s keep reading and see how God responds.</p>

<h2>Joshua 7:10-15</h2>
<p>In Joshua 7:10-15, we see God’s direct response to Joshua’s complaint after the defeat at Ai. God rebukes Joshua, making it clear that the issue isn’t with Him but with Israel’s sin. The people have violated the covenant by taking some of the devoted things—items that were supposed to be destroyed or set apart for God’s treasury. God reveals that this disobedience has caused Him to withdraw His presence, leading to Israel’s defeat. This highlights the serious consequences of sin, which affects not just the individual but the entire community.</p>

<p>God’s instructions to Joshua are clear: the people must consecrate themselves and prepare to identify and address the sin in their midst. Until the sin is dealt with, God will not be with them. The punishment for the guilty party is severe—total destruction for the individual and all that belongs to them. This reflects the holiness of God and the seriousness of violating His covenant.</p>

<p>This passage prompts several important reflections.</p>

<ul>
    <li>What does God’s rebuke teach us about taking responsibility for sin rather than blaming Him? </li>
    <li>Why do you think God viewed the actions of one person (Achan) as affecting the entire nation? </li>
    <li>What does this reveal about God’s view of sin and its consequences?</li>

    <p>In today’s context, we must ask ourselves: </p>

    <li>How can unaddressed sin affect not just us personally but our families, communities, or churches? </li>

    <p>Finally, these verses invite us to consider our response to sin. </p>

    <li>Have you ever found yourself blaming God or others for a situation when the root cause was sin in your own life? </li>
    <li>What steps can we take to be vigilant about sin in our own lives and communities?</li>
</ul>

<p>Reflecting on these questions can help us remain attentive to sin and maintain our relationship with God.</p>

<h2>Joshua 7:16-21</h2>
<p>In Joshua 7:16-21, God’s method for identifying the one who sinned begins with a public process: the tribes are brought forward, followed by the clans, and finally, the individual is revealed. Achan is singled out as the one who disobeyed God’s command, and when confronted, what does he do? He immediately admits his sin.</p>

<p>Achan admits that he saw the valuable items in Jericho, coveted them, and took them—disobeying God’s clear instruction that everything in the city was to be devoted to destruction. He hid the items in his tent, thinking no one would know.</p>

<p>This moment shows us how sin can start small, often with a simple desire or temptation. Achan’s actions weren’t impulsive—they were the result of a decision to disobey God’s direct command. </p>

<p>His confession should show us: sin often begins in our hearts and minds, with a desire for things that don’t belong to us, and if unchecked, it leads to actions that violate God’s holiness.</p>

<p>Somethings to think about:</p>
<ul>
<li>What does Achan’s sin reveal about how temptation can progress from thought to action?</li>
<li>How can we identify and address the seeds of sin before they lead to bigger consequences?</li>
</ul>

<p>Our choices, especially sinful ones, have a ripple effect. Sin doesn’t just stay between us and God; it affects others around us, whether we realize it or not.</p>

<p>How can we be more mindful of the impact our actions have on our families, churches, and communities?</p>

<p>In the end, Achan’s sin was exposed, and the consequences were severe, but this story reminds us of the importance of integrity and obedience to God. </p>

<p>How can we stay vigilant against the temptation to sin and protect ourselves from making choices that could harm others? </p>

<p>Reflecting on these questions helps us understand the gravity of our actions and encourages us to live with a greater awareness of God’s holiness and the community around us.</p>

<h2>Joshua 7:22-26</h2>
<p>For the wages of sin is…? (Romans 6:23) For the wages of sin is death, but the gracious gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord. </p>

<p>We deserve death for our sin, like we brutally saw here with Achan. But our story isn’t over so quickly. Our great God and Savior Jesus Christ gives us merciful grace and gives us eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord. Ain’t that somethin’!</p>

<p>In Joshua 7:22-26, the consequences of Achan’s sin are laid bare for all to see. After Achan admits to taking what was devoted to the Lord, his stolen items—gold, silver, and a cloak—are found buried in his tent. Then, without hesitation, the full weight of God’s judgment is carried out. </p>

<p>Achan, his family, and everything he owns are taken to the valley of Achor, where they are stoned to death, and the stolen items are burned. The place is forever marked as a reminder of the cost of sin.</p>

<p>This is a brutal picture, but it’s a necessary one. Sin is never private. Achan thought he could hide his sin, but nothing was hidden from God. His disobedience didn’t just cost him—it cost his family and the entire nation of Israel. Sin doesn’t just affect the sinner—it ripples out, impacting everyone around us.</p>

<strong>
    <p>Have we ever justified our sin thinking it won’t affect anyone else?</p>
</strong>

<p>God’s holiness cannot tolerate sin. We see here that disobedience is not something to be taken lightly or shrugged off. Sin brings death—it’s not just a mistake, a flaw, or an unfortunate choice. Achan’s sin led to death—death for him, his family, and all the destruction that followed.</p>

<p>We like to soften the reality of sin, to treat it as if it’s something we can easily overlook or dismiss. But sin is serious. The judgment Achan faced should make us stop and ask ourselves how seriously we take sin in our own lives. It’s easy to justify small acts of disobedience, but every sin is an offense to God’s holiness. Sin costs more than we think, and it always leads to destruction.</p>

<p>What small compromises in our lives could lead to bigger consequences down the road?</p>

<p>The valley of Achor becomes a memorial, reminding Israel—and us—that sin always leads to trouble. We cannot escape the consequences of disobedience, no matter how hidden or small it may seem at the time.</p>

<h2>To End</h2>

<p>After looking at the gravity of sin in Joshua 7, we need to remember that our hope isn’t found in our own strength or ability to be perfect. Just like the Israelites, we’re prone to failure and disobedience. But the good news is that we have a great high priest, Jesus, who has made a way for us to approach God, not through our own works, but through His sacrifice.</p>

<p>Let’s read Hebrews 10 to remind ourselves of this incredible truth.</p>

<h3>Hebrews 10:19-25</h3>
<p>In Hebrews 10:19-25, the author begins by reminding believers of the confidence they have to approach God because of Jesus’ sacrifice. Verses 19-22 highlight the new and living way opened for us by Jesus’ body, encouraging us to draw near to God with a sincere heart and full assurance. This means that our relationship with God is no longer hindered by sin, as Jesus has dealt with it once and for all. </p>

<p>How does this bold access to God through Jesus impact the way we live out our relationships with others in the faith? This access isn't just for us individually; it compels us to live in community, supporting one another in our shared faith.</p>

<p>How does Jesus’ sacrifice change the way we approach God, especially considering our own imperfections?</p>

<p>The writer also encourages believers to hold unswervingly to the hope they profess, knowing that God is faithful to keep His promises (v. 23). This is a hope that is rooted in God’s unchanging nature, not in fluctuating circumstances. It is a hope that perseveres even in times of trial. </p>

<p>Why is it so important to hold firmly to this hope? </p>

<p>In your life, what are some challenges that might cause you to lose hope, and how can remembering God’s faithfulness help you press on?</p>

<p>Verses 24-25 go on to stress the importance of not neglecting meeting together, especially in times of trial and difficulty. “Not abandoning our own meeting together, as is the habit of some, but encouraging one another” (v. 25). The early church understood that meeting together regularly is essential for mutual accountability, encouragement, and strengthening one another. </p>

<ul>
    <li>Why is meeting together so important in the Christian life?</li>
    <li>And what are the consequences of neglecting this, both for the individual and the community?</li>
</ul>

<h3>Hebrews 10:26-36</h3>

<p>The tone shifts in verses 26-31 with a serious warning about the consequences of deliberate sin. The author makes it clear that if someone continues to sin willfully after receiving the knowledge of the truth, there is no longer any sacrifice for sin—only a fearful expectation of judgment. The writer describes rejecting Christ as trampling the Son of God underfoot and insulting the Spirit of grace. </p>

<ul>
    <li>What does it mean to deliberately keep on sinning after knowing the truth? </li>
    <li>How does this sober warning challenge the way you think about sin in your life? </li>
    <li>What is the seriousness of rejecting Christ’s sacrifice?</li>
</ul>

<p>In verses 32-36, the author shifts back to encouragement, reminding believers of their past endurance in the faith. They joyfully accepted the loss of their possessions, knowing they had eternal treasures that could never be taken away. This is not just a call to remember past struggles but to recognize that every trial, every moment of endurance, has been redeemed by the grace of God through Jesus Christ. Their perseverance wasn't in vain—it was rooted in the hope of salvation and eternal life.</p>

<p>How can remembering past endurance help you persevere in faith today?</p>

<p>Reflecting on God’s faithfulness in the past isn’t just about strengthening our resolve; it’s about recognizing that our endurance has already been made possible because of Jesus’ sacrifice. We endure not on our own strength, but through the power of the One who conquered sin and death. The reward for perseverance is not just a future promise; it is an ongoing reality of redemption through Christ.</p>

<p>The writer reminds them that God’s reward for those who endure is sure (v. 36). God’s promises will be fulfilled because Jesus has already secured them through His death and resurrection. No matter how hard the journey, we can be assured that our faith is not in vain, because Jesus is our ultimate reward.</p>

<p>The passage concludes by urging faithful endurance, with the certainty that those who persevere will receive what God has promised. In Jesus, we are guaranteed a victory that is already won. The redemption we’ve been promised is not just in the future but is available to us in the here and now.</p>

<p>What promise is given to those who persevere in faith?</p>

<p>How does the promise of God’s reward motivate you to remain faithful, even when faced with trials?</p>

<p>Finally, the author warns against complacency, calling us to remain vigilant and aware of the gravity of sin, but more importantly, to never lose sight of the redemption offered through Jesus Christ. Our faith is rooted in the life, death, and resurrection of Jesus, and it’s through Him that we find the strength to endure.</p>

<p>How can we avoid becoming complacent or careless in our faith?</p>

<p>What steps can we take to ensure that we don’t neglect the seriousness of sin or the gift of grace?</p>

<p>This passage calls us to recognize both the weight of our sin and the immeasurable grace we’ve been given in Christ. </p>

<p>Through faith in Him, we have the power to endure, to overcome, and to live in the hope of eternal redemption. We are not left to fight alone—we are united in Christ, empowered by His grace, and promised the ultimate victory.</p>
