    <h2 id="written">Written Review</h2>
    <p>Harry Potter, a now beloved franchise for myself. In my first Harry Potter Review: <a href="../docs/hp-1-review.html" target="_blank">Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone</a>, I was very excited about reading Harry Potter. And Book One was 5/5 for me!</p>
    
    <p>Book Two, Chamber of Secrets, also a 5/5!</p>
    
    <p>I am enjoying the writing style of J.K. Rowling very much so. I appreciate the stories she told, and I really enjoyed the mystery with this book. I didn't know the answer to the mystery of the whole book, and that exciting!</p>
    
    <p>Harry and Ron have truly developed as characters and I'm enjoying Dumbledore as headmaster!</p>
    
    
    <h2 id="final">Final Words</h2>
    <p>There isn't much more to say, other than, if you've not read Harry Potter for yourself, I'd highly recommend!</p>
