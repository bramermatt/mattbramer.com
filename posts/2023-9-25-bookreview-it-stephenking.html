        <h2>Written Review</h2>
        <p>Now this is something special. Wow. Stephen King has a masterpiece here. I love this. I'm constantly impressed by Stephen King and how he writes and how his stories play out, and how the intricacy of the "magic" interacts on the world. SO GOOD. </p>
        
        <p>This was a beautiful, gruesome, epic, magical, terrible, and awesome. There were scenes in this book that had me smiling from ear to ear, there were scenes in this book that had me literally skipping the pages because it was so horrific and disgusting. This is truly something incredible.</p>
        
        <p>Horror and exciting, and just awesome. I loved this book. </p>
        
        <p>These characters are incredible, one I dislike constantly, but these characters are great and strong and distinct. I think that is something that is important in a crew story, but I'll also say these are some interesting characters. They are consistent and smart and have specific strengths and weaknesses. I think they're amazing. </p>
    
        <p>The horror of this book was awesome and epic, the writing is really great. GREAT BOOK!</p>

        <p>Let's try to do this absolutely incredible epic summarized. </p>
        
        <h2>1957</h2>
        <p>The story starts with the titular yellow coat and floating boat. It's 1957, Bill stutters, and his little brother George has a boat after a flood and waterproof it and George is scared of an IT. Our group of friends, who eventually call themselves The Loser's Club, come up against bullies and a terror coming from... somewhere. </p>
        
        <h2>1985</h2>
        <p>The story comes back 28 years later, the Loser's Club have already faced this terror once can they do it again?</p>
        
        <h2>IT</h2>
        <p>OH DEAR LORD, this is incredible. This is something I knew little about and I love this. IT is the Eater of Worlds, here before Time and created by The Turtle, working through the Macroverse. IT's essence is the Deadlights. IT is a Glamour, a shape-shifter. I love this magic system. </p>
        
        <h2>The Ending</h2>
        <p>Oh the ending? I loved it, King sets up what is going to happen and it comes through perfectly. The ending not being great is blown out of proportion, certainly.</p>
