    <h2 id="tour">Leaving for Work</h2>
    <p>Today was my first offical Bike Commute to Work! At the time of writting this portion of my blog, I have yet to ride home. We'll see how that goes, and I'll add that to the end of the blog.</p>

    <h2 id="to-work">Ride to Work</h2>
    <p>The Ride was a beautiful ride! I got to ride in with the sunrise, and it was amazing! The ride was tough for sure. I packed the bike with all sorts of things, as you saw in the video.</p>
    
    <p>I had my backpack (heavy) and a pannier pack filled with body wash / shampoo, clothes, lunch, and 3 water bottles, and a coffee. HEAVY. Too heavy. It was tough because I hadn't ridden with any of those things on before, but I survived. I had to get off and walk a bit of the Walking Bridge because of the gears on my bike (my fault), but other than that a nice ride.</p>

    <p>This is the workout to work, felt pretty good about this! The elevation is what's getting me for sure! The bridge is steep!</p>

    <p>I made it work, congrats, now what? Time to shower, luckily there is a shower at my work. So I took advantage of it and it was delightful. Water started out cold, but warmed up and felt good to get cleaned up for a hard day's work!</p>

    <h2 id="next">Next Ride</h2>
    <p>I did it! I made it all the way to work and back home. I can't believe that I've actually done it.</p>
    
    <p>Took me a month to build up this strength. And I'm so proud of myself, if I'm being honest. I am certainly enjoying riding my bike and I had only practiced riding on my lunch breaks (my previous Bike-Commute Blogs) to the walking bridge and back. That's a total of 6 miles. However, if you ride to work (6 miles) and ride home (6 more miles) - a total of 12 miles.</p>
    
    <p>That's more than 6 miles... so I was a little nervous for my ride home. But I did it. I did it even faster than my ride <em>to</em> work.</p> 
    
    <p>So there it is, I did it. The full 12 miles. I have been building up to this, and now I did it again today (August 2, 2022). So, I'm going to try to ride 4 days a week (Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, and Friday). Not Wednesday as it would take too long to ride to church. Now, this first week, we'll see how I feel. I felt pretty tired once I arrived home for my first full day.</p>
    
    <p>I imagine this first week, I may drive on Friday, but we'll just have to see. As for the blogs continuing, I'm having a bit of a crisis. I don't know what to do, I don't think I need to write these blogs anymore as I finally did it. I had a goal: <em>Bike Commute to Work</em>, and I did that. Now what?</p>
    
    <p>Maybe it's time to continue to ride the bike, but start a new hobby or continue a current hobby! Maybe I'll read more, now that I have my lunches free again!</p>
    
    <p>Alright, that's all folks! Thank you for following me on this little journey, I hope you all have a great day!</p>
