    <blockquote>A GAME OF THRONES IS SO SO GOOD! | Book One Review - Book Review on YouTube</blockquote>

    <h2 id="written">Written Review</h2>
    <p>First off, I've seen the entire Game of Thrones show. I don't remember much of the show, other than.. well I'll leave that for another time. But I don't remember much of the show and I'm excited to read this series, and I'm just starting with Book One right now as I work through my Too Be Read list. I'm excited to see what this book does!</p>

    <p>I am absolutely impressed by this book. The Characters are incredibly deep, that is the same with World Building, and Plot. Wow. I love this multiple character viewpoint, you get to see characters from all sides and that is really cool! You get to learn so much from each person, and you keep getting more. AMAZING.</p>



    <h2>Spoilers</h2>
    <p>Just a bit of preamble here.. the way this review will be is a lot of different from others. I'm wrote notes on every single chapter that I read. Which is completely spoiler, so this is where the spoilers start.. read at your own risk!</p> 
     

    <details>
        <summary>Notes As I Read</summary>
       
        <h2>Prologue</h2>
        <p>Oh whoa! This was crazy! This was terrifying.. wow. I'm really amazed by this so far. I like the writing so far, really. I'm intrigued so far!</p>
        
        <h2>Bran</h2>
        <p>Okay, here we go! This is so good. I really like this story so far. I like the way that these characters are completely different - I really like this. I'm interested in this story, being that I'm in the middle of some other series like Wheel of Time and The Stormlight Archive, this is a good book so far.</p>
        
        <h2>Catlyn</h2>
        <p>Wow, this is big. I really like this so far.</p>
        
        <h2>Daenerys</h2>
        <p>Okay now I'm seeing a big difference between what I've read so far. This book has been pretty brutal so far, and scary (with this Other) and I've read some violence before, but this - and I mean, I've seen the show, so I know it's a bit graphic with sex and other things, but hmm I don't know. It'll be different to read, I think. I'm very worried for Dany here. I know what happens, since I've seen the show, and the remembering of the show is coming back, so I'm very worried about Dany.</p>

        <h2>Jon</h2>
        <p>Wow, I love Jon so much haha. He's great! And Tyrion was very nice to Jon. I like that.</p>

        <p>I'm noticing that all these characters, save a few, are young characters. I mean really young. Early teens to even younger than 10 and it is portrayed very well.</p>

        <h2>Catelyn</h2>
        <p>Okay, our first foray into a bit of sexual content here. This is, for me, my first reading of any sexual content - I did start reading Fifty Shades of Grey, but I haven't gotten very far into that book so I haven't seen much of that, but this is very mild so far. Her loins, his seed, that's what we got here.</p>

        <p>I'm really enjoying this book, I really am, the treachery, the scandals. This is good!</p>

        <h2>Arya</h2>
        <p>I love Arya - I'm really happy to see her and Jon. She's a great character so far!</p> 

        <p>I am still enjoying this book, but I want to get back to Wheel of Time quickly. I might start with the Audiobook and read the book at the same time... let's see! Turns out I canceled my Audible subscription so I have no more credits left!</p>

        <h2>Bran</h2>
        <p>The infamous scene, at least I know this scene from the show.. but here it is on paper. Very interest from Bran's perspective - 'he was hurting her, but she wasn't pushing him away'.. interesting.</p>

        <h2>Tyrion, Jon, Daenerys, Eddard</h2>
        <p>Well I can't say anything but this is an amazing book. I'm impressed. Wow. Characters full of life and so vastly different, worldbuilding so deep, story very interesting...</p>

        <h2>Tyrion</h2>
        <p>Tyrion is my favorite. wow.</p> 

        <h2>Catelyn</h2>
        <p>Wow. I keep saying that. Good greif. This book is doing it!</p>

        <h2>Sansa</h2>
        <p>Happy Matt.</p>

        <h2>Eddard, Bran, Catelyn, Jon, Eddard, Tyrion</h2>
        <p>Hey, this is great! I really am enjoying this so far. I like this Bran flying with the three-eyed hawk.. interesting. And I can't stop thinking about Tyrion - he's great!</p>

        <p>The first metion of WHITE WALKERS! So far they've been known as The Others.</p>

        <h2>Arya, Daenerys</h2>
        <p>Okay maybe Arya and Daenerys are my favorites?! Wow, these are such good characters! This is a fascinating story!</p>

        <h2>Bran, Eddard, Jon</h2>
        <p>Oh Samwell Tarly! Jon is such a good guy. It's so easy to love the Starks.. at least right now. I don't see anything turning against that feeling, but they're good.</p>

        <h2>Eddard, Catelyn, Sansa</h2>
        <p>Even the Hound I care for, this is great!</p>

        <h2>Eddard, Tyrion, Arya, Eddard</h2>
        <p>A lot of stuff happening here. Tyrion getting taken and then being able to help in the fight. Arya sneaking and being awesome. Eddard dropping his Hand pin because Robert wanted to kill Daenerys.. wow.</p>

        <p>Great!</p>
