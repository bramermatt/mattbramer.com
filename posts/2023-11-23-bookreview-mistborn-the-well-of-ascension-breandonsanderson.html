<h2>Written Review</h2>
<p>This is a great book. I wanted this to be excellent. I started this novel fresh off of Rhythm of War by Brandon Sanderson, book four in the Stormlight Archive - so I was trying to come back to this series after catching up to that other series. BUT, THIS BOOK WAS SPECTACULAR, for the most part. </p>

<p>This book deals with the aftermath of book one, Mistborn: The Final Empire. How do you control an empire after stopping the previous empire? Well, Polotics! And that's the part of this story that definitely slowed down the progress of this story. I wanted more out of the beginning of this story. The thing that saved this book for me were the revelations, the intrigue, the magic system, and the Sanderlanch. </p>

<p>The entire book was, seemingly, slower than what I was wanting. But truly, Sanderson is a spectacular author and creator for this world. You definitely see how this world works and how the magic system has control of the world. There are evils and there are secrets everywhere. Like I said, there are revelations in this book and I couldn't get enough of that. Everytime there were mentions of .... I was stuck to the page, I couldn't stop reading and reading. It was so good. I am impressed by how Brandon Sanderson writes magic systems and this is another example of an excellent magic system and how it was developed in the world. It makes sense in the world and there are still more questions that I have regarding the magic system, I don't think we've seen it all yet. </p>

<p>This is book two of, as of December 2023, seven. This is book two in Mistborn Era 1, there is a second Era that occurs later in the Cosmere timeline. I can't wait to read more! </p>

<p>The brutality of this book, is nearly second to none for me. I have read Stephen King and seen how he describes horror and violence and this book comes very near the same violence you'd read in a horror novel. Heads are ripped apart, people are cut in half, arms are ripped off, more, brutal. I really wasn't expecting that in this series, but I really enjoyed it! </p>

<p>There is love in this book, there is death in this book, there is a lot in this book. Characters you love, find love. Characters you love, find death. Characters you love, ARE AWESOME! Ahh, I love this book. </p>

<p>We also see more of the world, and I think that is awesome considering this book has THREE MAPS! The whole world map, then another world map, then specifically Luthadel. Now we see more of that. I like that. I'm excited to get more of that in more books.</p>

<p>This book starts fast, then slows down, and ends on something that leads to an incredible third book in a trilogy.</p>

    <p><strong>Prose 5</strong> Smart, and intriguing.</p>

    <summary>Spoiler Story Breakdown</summary>
    
    <p><strong>Spoiler Thoughts</strong> This was something epic. I really enjoyed this book. I was so excited to read this book after coming back to this series, and this book started slow, like I mentioned. The Poloticking of the Assembly and Elend really slowed down the story and I just wanted to get past that. I worry that those story beats weren't important to the story, but everytime I think about that in different stories - I'm always incorrect. But, I was happy to get past the poloticking.</p> 

    <p><strong>Sazed</strong> was one of my favorite characters from book one, and now.. EVEN MORE SO my favorite character. I'm so interested in Feruchemy and I loved how Sazed was able to use his minds and held the gate against the koloss and Sazed's connection with Tindwyl, I'm so sad that she is gone now. </p>

    <p><strong>Clubs, Dox, Tindwyl</strong> ahh, this hit me hard. So very quickly did these people die and I was shook!</p>
     
    <p><strong>Elend</strong> is a MISTBORN! Oh wow, that was something special after coming into contact with the Well. And now is the Emporer and that is awesome! I'm happy that he and Vin are married now, that is something I wasn't expecting and I think this is great - I liked the quick marriage. </p>
     
    <p><strong>Vin</strong> whoa. She is BRUTAL. She is AWESOME. Powerful, and just so smart... although, Vin released something from the Well, and I'm interested to see what the heck that is. </p>
     
    <p><strong>Kandra and Koloss</strong> I really love this. I am so interested in these creatures and I appreciate that Vin, and probably more people, are able to control both of these. It is with the duralumin that increasing the power manyfold and I'm interested to see more!</p>
     
    <p><strong>Questions</strong></p>

    <ul>
        <li>What is the Deepness?</li>
        <li>What did Vin release from the Well of Ascension?</li>
        <li>What are the spikes in Inquisitors?</li>
        <li>What/Who is the Voice inside of Zane, Marsh, Vin, Vin's mother?</li>
    </ul>
