    <h2>Written Review</h2>
    <p>What an incredible novel. A story with more and more given on every page. A story with so much power and so much strength through every character. </p>
    
    <p>This is a story with a huge world, love the map, a lot of characters, a tight story, a long history, and an epic setting. I love this story, I love the magic here and I’m excited to see what happens next. The writing style here is quick and easy to read. The worldbuilding is deep and interesting. I am a HUGE fan of foreshadowing, and that’s actually one of the reasons I’m losing interest in the Harry Potter series because of its lack of foreshadowing. But, the foreshadowing in the Stormlight Archive is there and readily available. </p>
    
    <p>This book is epic and has epic moments of triumph, as well as, defeat. It hurts sometimes, and sometimes you are jumping out of your seat like you’re at a marvel movie on release night. I’ve been trying to categorize this series in my mind for a while now, since I’ve read this series, and that’s how I’d describe it - EPIC MOMENTS. I’ve somewhat felt down on this series as I think about it, but I really enjoyed my first time through and I’m really enjoying this read so far. I love the epic moments and they are certainly earned. I look forward to seeing what happens with the magic system and these characters as we continue on. </p>
    
    <p>I am really interested in this magic system. It’s new and fresh, I love the multiple realms that we have in play here - that is something in a fantasy world I really love reading about. Something that I would be actually interested in writing into my own story! </p>
    
    <p>I’m excited to read on!</p>

    <h2>Why I’m Rereading</h2>
    <p>I first read this book in April of 2022, and I thoroughly enjoyed that read; in fact I’ve read up until Oathbringer (book three in the series!). I’m actually rereading the series in preparation for reading the second novella, Dawnshard, and the fourth full novel, Rhythm of War, in the series! I purchased those a while back, and I’ve read a lot of other books and series since I’d read this series before so I thought I was in need of a reread!</p>

    <p>Blown away by this story when I first read this, having read what I’ve read after my first read… I’m still so invested!</p>
    
    <h2>Characters 5</h2>
    <p>This is where Brandon Sanderson shines!</p>
    
    <h2>Plot 4</h2>
    <p>A good start to this series, I believe. A great introduction to this book, the plot held through most of the book but 1,007 pages there might not be some bits that really hook you. Still, a great plot!</p>
    
    <h2>Prose 4</h2>
    <p>Here’s what I’ll say: easy, quick, and simple. </p>
    
    <h2>World Building 5</h2>
    <p>Roshar, Shattered Plains, Spren, Magic… ahh so good!</p>

        <h2>Magic System</h2>
    <p>STORMLIGHT! Ah, this is epic. In The Way of Kings we don’t get much of what this magic system can do, it seems. We get a rocket launch from the Prologue with Szeth and his lashings and shards and shardblades and shardplates, wow. I’m super excited to learn more about the Knights Radiant… Knight Radiants? Windrunners, Elsecallers, Bondsmiths, and more! LOVE IT! </p>
    
    <p>The Immortal Words, so you just have to say these words to gain these powers and spren? I’m really interested in seeing how and who can gain these powers?</p>
    
    <h2>Spren</h2>
    <p>Excited to learn more about spren, what a great introduction to these.. things.</p>
    
    <h2>World</h2>
    <p>I love Roshar, so interesting with highstorms and the Shattered Plains, and crem and animals and plants that change when highstorms come or humans interact… just so neat!</p>
    
    <h2>Kaladin</h2>
    <p>Here is a unique story here, I’m really interested to see the progression in Kaladin’s story. Smart, a very troubled past, and a good example of depression in an epic fantasy story, done well. </p>
    
    <h2>Dalinar</h2>
    <p>Huge fan of Dalinar, you love to see a great guy in a high status - there are so many stories, this story included, where men of high rank are horrible people. Dalinar is different. Dalinar is AWESOME. Strong, smart, and powerful.</p>
    
    <h2>Shallan</h2>
    <p>I was more impressed with Shallan on my reread here, at first I wanted to get back to Kaladin’s storyline, but Shallan is just great. She’s smart, funny, quick, and ready for action. </p>
