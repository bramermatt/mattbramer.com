<h2 id="written">Written Review</h2>
<p>This is the classic movie 2001: A Space Odyssey, and I did not enjoy it. I was bored and confused and this took me a few days to watch. That's okay, but I just didn't enjoy my time. I wanted to finish the movie and that's why I gave it the score I gave it.</p>

<p>The visuals were great here, but the story just took a long time to get into anything, and I wasn't impressed with the story.</p>

<details>
    <summary>Spoiler Alert</summary>
        <h2>The Apes</h2>
        <p>THE DAWN OF MAN, when I saw this.. oh boy I was scared. Scared, not as in I didn't want to watch, scared, as in "what on earth amd I about to see?". And in fact, what on earth did I just see? This was crazy and clearly these were just people in Ape suits and I laughed more than anything. But then this object showed up, and okay?</p>

        <h2>Thoughts</h2>
        <p>Now, I don't want to bash this movie, because I know there are a lot of people that love this movie. And, I don't feel the same way, and I did love the imagery of the whole movie, so that's what I want to show here..</p>

        <h2>Hal 9000</h2>
        <p>I loved Hal, he was great and his voice was very good for the character.</p>

        <h2>Set Design</h2>
        <p>The Set Design was superb! I loved it!</p>

        <h2>Suits</h2>
        <p>The suits looked a little flimsy, but still, I'm sure it was fun to wear!</p>

    <h2>Score</h2>
    <p>I'm trying a new way of reviewing, by implementing a new way to review - using a format taken from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@2ToRamble" target="_blank">2toRamble</a>! <em>And that's the system! Rate those 5 categories out of 10, average your score, and that's your /10 Rambler Rating! You can rate each category to the nearest hundredth, tenth, whole number, or whatever you please.</em></p>
        
    <p>For this scoring breakdown.. 3 out of 5, and exactly 3/5. This was an interesting watch..</p>
