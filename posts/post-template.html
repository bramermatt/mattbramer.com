                <p> Lindsay Chervinsky’s The Cabinet is a fascinating look at how George Washington created the first presidential cabinet, shaping an institution that wasn’t originally outlined in the Constitution. The book does a great job of explaining why Washington felt the need for this advisory group and how key figures like Hamilton, Jefferson, Knox, and Randolph influenced its development.</p>

                <p>What I really appreciate about The Cabinet is how detailed yet readable it is. Chervinsky explains the political challenges of the time without overcomplicating things, making it easy to follow along. She also does a great job of showing how Washington’s leadership decisions shaped the presidency going forward.</p>
                    
                <p>If you’re interested in early American history or how the government evolved, this book is definitely worth a read. It’s well-researched, engaging, and provides a deeper understanding of how the cabinet became such an important part of the U.S. government.</p>
