                <p>It would be disingenuous to write this review as if I've never read Oathbringer before. I have, in fact, read Oathbringer THREE TIMES NOW! So, with this review, I will be looking at <strong>Dalinar and the Challenge of Redemption</strong>. This will be a first for me, in reviewing a specific character for an entire review. You may read my previous reviews here: <a href="2022-11-29-bookreview-oathbringer-brandonsanderson.html" target="_blank">other Oathbringer Reviews here</a>!</p>

                <p><strong>Spoilers ahead! If you haven’t read Brandon Sanderson’s Stormlight Archive, up to and including Oathbringer, beware!</strong></p>

                <h2>"You cannot have my pain."</h2>



<p>These five words mark the climax of *Oathbringer*, the third installment in Brandon Sanderson's *Stormlight Archive*. One of the most significant character transformations in the entire Stormlight Archive—which is saying something, because every character here is broken and burdened, in need of redemption. With Dalinar, that is no exception.</p>

<p>These words, are simple, yet dense. In that moment, Dalinar Kholin doesn't defeat Odium with a weapon, he wins by refusing to surrender the very thing that defines his fall: his pain. </p>

<p>Dalinar's arc isn't a typical redemption story. It's not about moving on from past mistakes. It's about standing in the middle of them—broken, ashamed, remembered—and still choosing to become someone new. It’s about owning the wreckage, not being owned by it.</p>

<p>And yet, his journey also raises profound questions. What does it mean to change? Can someone truly become good after doing so much evil? And if your transformation is *aided*—perhaps even *orchestrated*—by a godlike being, does that make it less authentic? </p>

<p>And here’s where we shift from the Cosmere: <strong>In our real world, that answer is yes, a thousand times yes.</strong> </p>

<h2> Real Redemption: A Gospel Lens</h2>

<p>In the world of Roshar, Dalinar’s redemption is hard-won. But in our world, the truth is even more staggering: <strong>redemption isn’t earned—it’s given.</strong> Freely.</p>

<p>As Paul writes in <strong>Romans 3:22–24</strong> (LSB): </p>

<blockquote>'even the righteousness of God through faith in Jesus Christ for all those who believe; for there is no distinction; for all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God, being justified as a gift by His grace through the redemption which is in Christ Jesus; ' <strong>Romans 3:22-24</strong></blockquote>

<p>That’s real grace. We don’t change ourselves and then come to God—He redeems us *while* we’re broken. He *remembers* our sin, yet justifies us anyway.</p>

<p>Dalinar’s struggle resonates so deeply because it echoes this truth: <strong>redemption requires ownership</strong>. But in Christ, it also requires surrender—to grace, not guilt.</p>

<p>That’s reality, in Christ. But with the Stormlight Archive, this is the tension at the heart of Dalinar's journey: <strong>redemption through accountability… and manipulation.</strong> Because there is always another secret.</p>

<h2> Roshar’s Tension: Accountability and Manipulation</h2>

<p>Back in the Stormlight Archive, Dalinar’s arc balances two forces: <strong>personal accountability and divine manipulation.</strong> As Brandon Sanderson would write, that’s the tension that pulses through *Oathbringer*. Cultivation doesn’t just encourage Dalinar—she *alters* him. She removes the memory of Evi’s death, creating a space where he can begin to grow. Only later, when he’s stronger, does she let him remember.</p>

<p>So the question becomes: Is this growth *authentic*? Or is it *engineered*?</p>

<p>This is the line Sanderson invites us to walk: <strong>Dalinar’s redemption was real—but not unaided.</strong> In the same way, we don’t become new people by ourselves. We need outside intervention. And for us, that intervention isn’t a Shard—it’s a Savior.</p>

<h2> The Weight Dalinar Carried</h2>

<p>Before he became the Bondsmith. Before the Stormfather. Before the unity. Dalinar Kholin was the <strong>Blackthorn</strong>—a warlord of unrelenting fury and unmatched brutality. He slaughtered his way to conquest. He tore through enemies with a primal hunger. He once drank himself numb so he wouldn't have to face what he had done. And worst of all <strong>(HUGE SPOILER)</strong>, he burned the city of Rathalas and incinerated its people—including his own wife, Evi.</p>

<p><em>This is not a man easily redeemed.</em></p>

<p>His transformation begins with memory loss. A gift—or a curse—granted by the Nightwatcher (Cultivation). She removes the memory of Evi from his mind, pruning his pain so that he might grow into something new. <strong>Only later, after he has begun to change, does the full memory return. The fire. The screams. The truth.</strong></p>

<p>This is the backdrop for one of the most painful and powerful arcs in all of fantasy. Dalinar must become a better man *before* he knows just how broken he was. And when he finally remembers? He doesn't crumble. He doesn’t excuse. He doesn’t deflect. He *stands* in it. <strong>“I will take responsibility for what I have done. If I must fall, I will rise each time a better man.”</strong></p>

<p>That’s the essence of Dalinar’s arc. He’s not redeemed because he forgets his sins. He’s redeemed because he remembers—and still chooses to fight for something more.</p>

<h2> Cultivation’s Hand </h2>

<p>But here’s where things get complicated. <strong>Cultivation is a Shard.</strong> She represents change, growth, pruning for purpose. She sees Dalinar’s potential and removes a key piece of his burden so he can reach it. She creates a space for transformation.</p>

<p>So… is Dalinar’s change real? Can you take credit for becoming a better person if someone *helped* you forget how bad you once were? This is the question of *Oathbringer*. Cultivation *chose* Dalinar. But he still had to walk the path. <strong>He had to endure the shame of rediscovered memory.</strong> He had to choose *not* to give his pain to Odium, who offered him escape and absolution. <strong>He had to *own* his pain.</strong> Sanderson doesn’t let us settle into easy answers. He makes us sit in the discomfort. </p>

<h2> The Moment He Refused to Break </h2>

<p>The confrontation with Odium is perhaps the most thematically loaded scene in the entire Stormlight Archive. And my goodness—it’s massive. Point-of-views crashing across Thaylen Field, epic prose, a wild battle... everything firing at once. Odium offers Dalinar exactly what he wants: relief, freedom, release from guilt. From pain. From the memory of screams. <strong>All he has to do is give it up. Let Odium take it.</strong> Let the Shard of passion and fury and righteous indignation *own* his agony.</p>

<p>But Dalinar doesn’t. He says no. <strong>“You cannot have my pain.”</strong></p>

<p>It’s one of the most powerful lines Sanderson has ever written. Because pain, here, is *not* a curse. It’s not something to be avoided or eliminated. <strong>It is the *proof* of change. The *proof* of growth.</strong> Dalinar’s pain is not his punishment-<strong>it is his reminder</strong>. It keeps him honest. It keeps him humble. And in that refusal, he reclaims not just himself… but something larger. He opens a Perpendicularity. He becomes the Bondsmith in full. <strong>He unites.</strong> That is how he defeats Odium—not with steel or Shards, but with truth.</p>

<h2> A Different Kind of Hero </h2>

<p>Dalinar isn’t Kaladin. He’s not the brooding, noble, tragic hero. He’s not Shallan, trying to reconcile fragments of self. He’s not Adolin, trying to prove himself in the shadow of others.</p>

<p><strong>Dalinar is a war criminal. A man rebuilt. A man haunted.</strong></p>

<p>And that’s what makes him the heart of *Oathbringer*. His redemption doesn’t make him perfect—it makes him *present*. He leads not because he’s clean, but because he *knows* the stakes of failure. He unites not because he’s a shining beacon, but because he’s lived through the darkness.</p>

<p>He is the embodiment of the First Ideal: <strong>"Life before death. Strength before weakness. Journey before destination."</strong></p>

<p>Dalinar chooses life when death seemed easier. <strong>He shows strength through surrender.</strong> And he commits to the journey, even when the destination remains uncertain.</p>

<h2> Final Thoughts: The Immortal Words</h2>

<p>This is where Sanderson turns the lens back on us. Dalinar’s arc doesn’t offer easy answers. It offers a challenge. <strong>It says: *Look at your pain. Don’t run from it. Don’t hand it off. Face it. Own it. And let it shape you into something better.</strong>* Amazing.</p>

<p>*Oathbringer* isn’t about saving the world—it’s about saving a man. A man who nearly destroyed everything he touched. <strong>A man who, in the end, refused to be defined by what he had done.</strong> </p>

<p>A man who became something more because he *chose* to bear the weight. I’ll never forget the feeling of reading that scene for the first time. The crackle of the Perpendicularity. The Stormlight. The unity. The power of pain reclaimed. It’s why Dalinar Kholin is my favorite character in the Cosmere. Not because he was always strong. But because he learned what strength really means. <strong>"Journey before destination."</strong></p>
