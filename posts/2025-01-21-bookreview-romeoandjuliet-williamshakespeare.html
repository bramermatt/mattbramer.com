        <p>To preface this review, I typically read books—not plays. This might be a unique read if you've never read it before. This is the popular stage play "Romeo and Juliet." This is the first time I've ever read this play, and I thoroughly enjoyed it! My goodness, does William Shakespeare know how to write a monologue. Beautifully written and well-paced, I appreciate what Shakespeare can do with this medium. I love the archaic language used, as this was written in 1597. WHOA!</p>

<p>These characters are well-developed and enjoyable on the page, but the theme that flowed through the book that I noticed was that beauty means love. Perhaps I'm looking too much into this, but it was a fairly surface-level look at love. That said, what stood out to me was the intense passion that drives the characters. Romeo and Juliet's whirlwind romance feels both thrilling and doomed from the start.</p>

<p>Shakespeare captures the impulsive, often irrational nature of young love, which makes the story both enchanting and tragic. The family feud between the Montagues and Capulets adds a layer of tension and inevitability to the narrative. Shakespeare does a masterful job of weaving this conflict into the personal tragedy of the lovers. This was a very well-developed theme.</p>

<p>One of the most remarkable aspects of "Romeo and Juliet" is Shakespeare's use of language and poetry. The play's dialogue is crafted in iambic pentameter, giving it a rhythmic and almost musical quality that brings out the emotions and intensity of the characters' experiences. Lines like "But, soft! What light through yonder window breaks?" are not just beautiful but also deeply expressive, capturing the wonder and intensity of young love. </p>

<p>The archaic language, though challenging at times, adds to the charm, transporting readers to a different time while still connecting them to universal human emotions. Despite the age of the text, the emotions and experiences depicted are timeless, resonating with readers and audiences even today.</p>

<p>Another aspect I admired was how the play balances light and dark. The humorous banter of characters like Mercutio and the Nurse made me want to read them more and more. I am a huge fan of Mercutio; he is definitely a good friend to Romeo and crew. This contrast makes the darker moments hit even harder, and this story certainly gets dark.</p>

<p>While the play's portrayal of love might feel overly simplistic at times—equating beauty with love—Shakespeare also explores deeper themes of fate and choice. Romeo and Juliet's love is intense but brief, echoing the impulsive and passionate nature of youthful love. It reminded me of how I felt when I was younger, and I'm sure those who have witnessed this play can relate to these characters in similar ways. Their struggles, desires, and defiance of societal norms are universal, making the play relatable across generations.</p>

<p>Reading "Romeo and Juliet" was a captivating experience. Despite being written centuries ago, its themes of love, conflict, and fate are still understandable and enjoyable to read. If you're new to Shakespeare or plays in general, I highly recommend giving it a read.</p>
