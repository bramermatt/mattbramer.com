    <h2>Alright, Big Changes</h2>
    <p>Take this whole document with a grain of salt.. I have completely changed this list because of <strong>The Wheel of Time</strong>! I have, since, writing this blog, bought the rest of the Wheel of Time books in the series that I have to read and I will be finishing that series before reading another series (at least that's the plan). Here is that video. And follow along with <a href="../pages/wheel-of-time-in-review.html">Wheel of Time in Review</a>.</p>

    <h2>I'm Having Such a Great Time Reading</h2>
    <p>2023, like 2022 looks like it's going to be an amazing year of reading! Here is a picture of my bookshelf, and as you can see there are a few different types of genres that I am going to be reading this year. As I wrote in the blog that said <a href="read-before-buy.html" target="_blank">I have to read what's on my bookshelf before I buy anymore books</a>, that's just what I'm going to do. These are all books that I purchased in 2022, because I wanted to read them, but I was reading something else. I'm currently reading The Dragon Reborn by Robert Jordan, book three in The Wheel of Time series, and I'm absolutely loving it! I received it as a Christmas gift from my parents - it was not on my bookshelf and I didn't purchase it for myself, so that still counts as being able to read it before I buy anymore books..</p>

    <h2>Genres</h2>
    <p>So on here are, some classics like The Hunger Games, The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes, The Fault in Our Stars, Fifty Shades of Grey, IT, The Shining, A Game of Thrones, and the Fellowship of the Ring. Others include some of my most anticipated reads, because I love the author or the series - and that's Mistborn: The Final Empire by Brandon Sanderson and Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Askaban by J.K. Rowling. I really look forward to reading those, but I don't konw when I'll get to those with all these books that are on my list.</p>

    <h2>Read All These in 2023?</h2>
    <p>I don't actually think that I'll have read all these books by the end of 2023, but it's a list at least. I know that I'll be reading these books and these alone - so that at least makes me happy to know that there is a plan in place. Now, it's just to decide which of these to read next!</p>
