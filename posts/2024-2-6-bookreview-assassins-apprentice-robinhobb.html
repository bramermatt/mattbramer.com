    <h2>Written Review</h2>
    <p>Well, I've heard Robin Hobb had excellent prose. Those reviews did not exaggerate one bit. Wow, this is beautifully written.</p>
    
    <p>This was an excellent novel. Whoa. Holy cow, seriously, this was an incredible story. Something that I'd not thought about, reading in the first person was actually very enjoyable. </p>
    
    <p>The character work is top-tier. I, wow, I really enjoyed this story. The plot, not like other stories I've read, was not the forefront of the prose. This was a story written for you to understand the characters. That didn't deter from the story at all, something I thought it would. This was such an exciting and interesting story. </p>
    
    <p>I am very impressed, and I am excited to continue this series. Luckily there are like 16 books in this whole series.</p>
    
    <p>There is a very intriguing magic system as well, that's something that I like reading. And this was something new and interesting to read about. There is some connection to animals, as well as mind-communication. It is really well written and described. I am happy to be in this world.  </p>
    
    <p>This story has been one of my favorites that I've read so far! </p>
