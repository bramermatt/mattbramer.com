    <h2>Trailer</h2>
    <p>Let's talk the trailer first.. <strong>DO NOT WATCH THE TRAILER IF YOU DON'T WANT TO BE SPOILED</strong>. I came into this movie completely blind and I will say the trailer spoils a majority of the enjoyment for sure. Please be warned.</p>

    <h2>Review</h2>
    <p>This is an absolute delight to watch! I was looking for the original Star Wars Holiday Special, and I couldn't seem to find it on Disney+, but I'll keep looking.</p>

    <p>If I'd have to give this a score, I'd say 5/5! This is a great Star Wars story. I didn't know what to expect when I started the movie, but this story takes you through the entire Skywalker Saga using a key to go to key points in the Star Wars Skywalker Saga inwhich we see important <em>Master and Padawan</em> moments. Great stuff!</p>

    <p>I was able to watch this with my son, Everett, and we had an absolute blast! He really enjoyed it!</p>

    <h2>Lego</h2>
    <p>In the past I've been a huge fan of Lego Star Wars games, and most recently I've embarked on a journey to complete The Lego Star Wars: Skywalker Saga on Switch! So, I've been around a bit with Lego Star Wars, but I'd never watched a full Lego Movie, or the Lego Movie really. I was a bit skeptical, but it turned out to look really great and be a fun time!</p>

    <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
    <p>There really isn't much to say, other than, if you're a Star Wars fan: you're going to love this!</p>

    <h2>More info</h2>
    <p>There can be more info on the movie here: <a href="https://disneyplusoriginals.disney.com/movie/the-lego-star-wars-holiday-special" target="_blank">Disney+ Originals: The Lego Star Wars Holdiay Special</a>.</p>
