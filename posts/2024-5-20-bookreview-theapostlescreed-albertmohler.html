                <h2>Written Review</h2>
                <p>Another AWESOME theological book! Dr. Albert Mohler is awesome. This is a smart look at this Apostles' Creed! I'll give you that text later, but wow, this is an incredibly detailed look at the entire creed. If you've heard of the Apostles' Creed before, this will be a FRESH LOOK. One thing I will, which is something that I LOVE, is Theological Density. Despite the clarity of Mohler's writing, the theological density of the material may still be challenging for readers with little prior theological education.</p>
                
                <p>I've read a lot of prior theological books, and this is just another rung on the theological ladder, pardon that analogy. Really quick read, also very impactful in my faith. Something good to understand, specifically for me, was the "He descended into hell". This is something that I am very interested in, what is hell and hades and sheol and gehenna? There is a chapter on that line, and it is very helpful!</p>

                <h2>The Apostles' Creed: What is it?</h2>
                <p>The Apostles' Creed is one of the oldest and most widely accepted creeds in Christianity. It is a succinct statement of Christian faith that outlines key doctrinal beliefs held by many Christian denominations. The creed is traditionally believed to have been composed by the apostles themselves, though it more likely developed over time as a summary of apostolic teaching. Here is the text of the Apostles' Creed:</p>
                
                <blockquote>
                    <strong>The Apostles' Creed:</strong>
                I believe in God, the Father Almighty,
                Maker of heaven and earth.
                
                And in Jesus Christ, His only Son, our Lord,
                who was conceived by the Holy Spirit,
                born of the Virgin Mary,
                suffered under Pontius Pilate,
                was crucified, dead, and buried.
                He descended into hell.
                The third day He rose again from the dead.
                He ascended into heaven,
                and sits at the right hand of God the Father Almighty.
                From thence He shall come to judge the living and the dead.
                
                I believe in the Holy Spirit,
                the holy catholic Church,
                the communion of saints,
                the forgiveness of sins,
                the resurrection of the body,
                and the life everlasting. Amen.</blockquote>
