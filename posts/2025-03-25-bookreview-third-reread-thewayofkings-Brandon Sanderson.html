                <h1>My Third Time Reading The Way Of Kings by Brandon Sanderson</h1>
                
                <h2>Introduction</h2>
                <p>This is a bit of a book review and a bit of a discussion. This is the third time I’ve read The Way of Kings by Brandon Sanderson, and each time, I love it even more. Opening those first pages feels like wrapping myself in a warm blanket—this book is a delight to read.</p>
                    
                <p>In the past, I’d alternate between reading and listening to the audiobook, but this time, I read every word. It was an entirely new experience, and it was so worth it. There’s something about fully immersing yourself in the text that I missed before, and this reread allowed me to catch details I hadn’t noticed when I was listening. It was wonderful.</p>
                    
                <p>For this reread, I decided to take my experience a step further by annotating the novel. I’ve highlighted books in the past, but this time, I went all out—post-it tabs in 11 different colors, tracking characters, major themes, foreshadowing, and worldbuilding details. I didn’t plan to annotate at first, but around page 113, I just started, and I couldn’t stop.</p>
                    
                <p>By the time I reached the end of its 1001 pages, nearly every one was marked. I even had to buy extra tabs after running out of my original colors. This makes me wonder how I’ll approach annotating the rest of The Stormlight Archive, especially since The Way of Kings is the shortest book in the series. If I keep this up, I’ll be buying tabs endlessly! A conundrum, indeed.</p>
                    
                <p>Despite those challenges, the process was worth it. Sanderson’s storytelling is rich with depth, and tracking each character’s journey brought new layers of appreciation.</p>
                    
                    
                <h2>Review</h2>
                    
                <p>The Way of Kings is epic. From the Prelude to the Epilogue, it delivers a grand-scale fantasy experience filled with diverse characters, intense battles, unique magic, and deep themes of honor, resilience, and leadership.</p>
                    
                <p>Each reread uncovers something new—subtle foreshadowing, deeper character arcs, and intricate worldbuilding details that make Roshar feel more alive. Annotating helped me follow the journeys of Kaladin, Dalinar, and Shallan in a way I hadn’t before.</p>
                    
                <p>Kaladin’s arc resonated with me even more this time. His struggles with depression and his journey toward reclaiming his purpose feel incredibly real and powerful. Dalinar’s transformation—his struggle to define honor and lead despite his past—is inspiring. And Shallan, who didn’t initially stand out to me as much, became far more compelling on this reread. Her wit, intelligence, and the complexity of her story add an emotional depth I hadn’t fully appreciated before.</p>
                    
                <p>Beyond the characters, Sanderson’s worldbuilding and magic system continue to amaze me. The slow unraveling of Stormlight, Shardblades, and spren is masterfully done, teasing just enough to keep the reader eager for more. The world of Roshar itself, with its relentless highstorms and unique cultures, is a masterpiece of fantasy worldbuilding.</p>
                    
                    
                <h2>Themes & Messages</h2>
                    
                <p>One thing that stood out to me even more on this reread is how deeply Sanderson weaves powerful themes into the story. Leadership, morality, resilience, and the burden of responsibility are all central to The Way of Kings.</p>
                    
                <p>Dalinar wrestles with the meaning of true honor. Kaladin struggles with self-worth and purpose. Shallan fights to define her own identity in a world that constantly tries to label her. Each of these arcs is powerful on its own, but together, they reinforce the book’s core ideals—the Knights Radiant oaths, particularly: Journey Before Destination,  Strength Before Weakness.</p>
                    
                <p>These ideals don’t just drive the characters; they resonate beyond the story itself. Sanderson presents the idea that struggle isn’t just an obstacle—it’s part of the journey, and it shapes who we become. That message feels especially meaningful on a reread, where you can see just how much these characters endure and grow.</p>
                    
                    
                <h2>Annotating: A New Way to Experience the Story</h2>
                    
                <p>This was my first time annotating The Way of Kings, and it completely changed my experience. I noticed so much more—small moments that felt minor on my first read now carried huge significance. Sanderson is a master of foreshadowing, and tracking my notes made it clear just how much groundwork he lays for future books.</p>
                    
                <p>If you’re considering annotating The Way of Kings, here’s my advice:
                <ul>
                    <li>Pick a few categories to track (characters, themes, foreshadowing, worldbuilding, etc.).</li>
                    <li>Start anywhere! I began on page 113 and never looked back.</li>
                    <li>Use different colors, but don’t worry about being too organized. The goal is engagement, not perfection.</li>
                </ul>
                </p>

                <h2>Foreshadowing & Future Books</h2>
                    
                <p>One of the most rewarding aspects of this reread was catching all the hints Sanderson plants early on. Details that seemed minor before now feel like giant neon signs pointing toward later events.</p>
                    
                <p>Without spoiling anything, I’ll say that Dalinar’s visions, Shallan’s drawings, and even offhand remarks about ancient history all take on massive significance when you know where the series is headed.</p>
                    
                <p>I also paid closer attention to the magic system this time. The way Stormlight functions, the old Radiants, and how spren interact with different characters—it’s clear Sanderson is meticulously constructing something far bigger than what’s on the surface.</p>
                    
                    
                <h2>Final Recommendation: Who Should Reread This?</h2>
                    
                <p>Would I recommend rereading The Way of Kings? Absolutely. This book rewards those who take the time to revisit it.</p>
                    
                <p>
                    That said, I know a 1000+ page book can be intimidating, especially with the rest of the series ahead. So, here’s my recommendation:
                    <ul>
                        <li>If you loved The Way of Kings but felt like you missed details, a reread will enhance your appreciation.</li>
                        <li>If you struggled with it the first time, consider an audiobook or reading along with a breakdown guide to stay engaged.</li>
                        <li>If you’re new to the series, take your time. The payoff is worth it.</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>

                <p>For me, this third reread has only cemented my love for The Stormlight Archive. It’s a series that grows with you, and I know I’ll be back again in the future. Next up: Words of Radiance—and I can’t wait.</p>
