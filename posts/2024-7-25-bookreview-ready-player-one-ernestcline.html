                <h2>Written Review</h2>
                <p>A really great start! An awesome world and quick writing. Sometimes the prose gets a little young for my taste, but I certainly enjoy this. I’ve been reading so many different things lately, so when I thought about when this book was written, I had to look but this was written in 2011! Whoa! </p>

                <p>A fun concept and pretty well executed. I’m interested to read more in this genre. I love the video game Watch Dogs, and I was looking for a good science fiction read and this is what came up. I’d heard the hype and so far, I can see why. This might not be for everyone and certainly, there are some chapters that make me want to skip ahead because of the dialogue. </p>
                    
                <p>Alright. I’m losing my interest. There is SO MUCH WORLDBUILDING. And possibly too much? I think I understand what we’re doing here. And Cline just continues to pound into the ground, this world and the Oasis. Just a lot for me. I'm in this world now, and I'm certainly noticing that we are living IN THIS WORLD. I don't know what is happening, but I feel like the story keeps slamming to a halt to relearn what is going on in the world. Things happen fast and then boom, time stops and Wade explains exactly what is going on in the world.</p>
                    
                <p>There have been multiple chapters that make me want to stop reading. There was a too long section about.. personal satisfaction, there were many times when the dialogue just isn't something I'm loving. </p>
                    
                <p>I feel the book has three distinct parts. Fast and fun start, abrupt halt and dragging middle, and a tidy resolution. The middle brings this book down a lot when it comes to reviewing it. I was having fun, and then I certainly wasn't. And then, near the end, I was back where I was enjoying myself. Overall, I wasn't very happy with this book.</p>
                    
                <p>*Ready Player One* by Ernest Cline is a novel set in a dystopian future where reality pales in comparison to the expansive virtual world of the OASIS. Published in 2011, the book quickly gained popularity, bolstered by its imaginative blend of futuristic technology and heavy doses of 1980s pop culture nostalgia. The story follows Wade Watts, a teenager obsessed with finding an Easter egg hidden within the OASIS by its late creator, James Halliday. The finder of this egg will inherit Halliday's fortune and control of the OASIS, sparking intense competition among "gunters" (egg hunters) and the ruthless corporation IOI.</p>
                    
                <p>The novel's themes of escapism and the importance of reality are somewhat compelling. The numerous 1980s references, from video games to movies and music, add an intriguing layer for those familiar with the era. However, for readers not as versed in 80s pop culture, these references can sometimes feel overwhelming and excessive, detracting from the story's overall impact. And I mean excessive. There are chapters that continue to name games, movies, and era-specific items. It gets to be a bit too much.</p>
                    
                <p>Cline's writing style, characterized by a fast-paced narrative and first-person perspective, keeps the plot moving swiftly. The detailed world-building of the OASIS is a highlight, showcasing an impressive virtual universe. Although, there are many sections where the plot slams on the brakes. The reliance on nostalgic references can feel heavy-handed, and the character development leaves something to be desired. Wade's character, while central to the plot, often comes across as one-dimensional, and the supporting characters, including Art3mis, Aech, Shoto, and Daito, don't receive the depth they deserve.</p>
                    
                <p>Despite its imaginative premise and engaging moments, *Ready Player One* falls short in delivering a fully satisfying reading experience. The book's overemphasis on 80s nostalgia and its sometimes shallow character development detract from what could have been a more universally appealing story. While fans of science fiction and 80s pop culture may find much to enjoy, those looking for a deeper, more nuanced narrative might feel disappointed.</p>
                    
                <p>Overall, I would rate *Ready Player One* 3 out of 5 stars. It offers an interesting concept and some engaging scenes, but its execution feels uneven. The heavy reliance on nostalgia and the lack of character depth make it a book that, while entertaining in parts, ultimately didn't fully resonate with me. If you're a fan of the 80s or virtual reality-themed stories, you might still find it worth a read, but it may not be the immersive experience you're hoping for.</p>
