                <!-- Post goes here -->
                <p>The Hope of Elantris is a short but powerful companion to Elantris, offering a fresh perspective of what happens around the climax of the original novel. Though brief, The Hope of Elantris is great! The characters, emotional depth, and a gripping sense of urgency propel this 25 page short story.</p>
                    
                <p>This story is best read after Elantris, as it draws strength from the world and events already established—but that’s not a flaw, it’s a feature. Sanderson’s storytelling once again shines, and this—among other recent authors I've read—inspired me to start writing stories of my own. </p>
                    
                <p>Quick, engaging, and rewarding—The Hope of Elantris is a must-read for any Elantris fan.</p>
                    
                <p>While it doesn't try to stand on its own, that’s what makes it work—it thrives as a companion piece. Seeing the events through a different character’s eyes adds a sense of scale and humanity to the chaos of the city’s fall and rebirth. If you loved Elantris, this story will only deepen your appreciation for the world and its people.</p>
