        <h2>I have done it!</h2>
        <p>I have been riding my bike since the beginning of August until now. And, at the start of this week October 18, 2022 the weather has gotten very cold. This week the mornings will start around 34 degrees, and that is just too cold for me to ride. Since the last <a href="bike-commute-part-nine.html">Bike Commute Blog: Part Nine</a>, there have been a lot of updates since the start of Bike Commuting. Since the start, I have ridden <strong>OVER 350 MILES</strong>!!! That is crazy to me, and I feel so great about that. This is more of a catchup blog, to talk about what has happened.</p>

        <h2>Where is My Bike?</h2>
        <p>I have gotten a bike garage, which is just a tent to store my bike when I'm not ridding it.</p>
        <img src="../img/docs/bike-commute-blogs/part-ten/bike-tent.JPG" alt="bike-tent" class="zoomE">
        <script src="../../../js/pictFullscreen.js"></script>
        <blockquote>My Bike in my tent</blockquote>
        
        <p>I keep the bike there, but since it's gotten so cold I'll be keeping my bike in the basement of the house; hopefully that will be helpful. I just don't want my tires to pop while it's so cold outside.</p>
        
        
        <h2>My bike at work</h2>
        <p>While doing video calls, I have been using this as my video background while my bike isn't with me. I have even started working from home every Wednesday, so I could ride my bike four days a week. I sit in front and it looks like my bike is behind me.</p>

        <blockquote>Bike background</blockquote>
        
        <p>I have since moved around my desk, but I can still use that background.</p>
        
        
        <h2>Bike Tours</h2>
        <p>Here are a few bike tours, and a few videos of what it was like riding in the very cold.</p>

        <h2>New Shoes and Pedals</h2>
        <p>For my birthday, I'm 26 now, my parents got me some new half clipless pedals and clipped in shoes.</p>
        
        <img src="../img/docs/bike-commute-blogs/part-ten/shoes-clips.JPG" alt="shoes-clips"class="zoomE">
        <script src="../../../js/pictFullscreen.js"></script>
        <blockquote>My new shoes and clipless pedals</blockquote>
        
        <p>Riding with these have been a lot of fun, I've gotten faster, and I had some issues with how the shoes were setup. I did readjust my shoes and that helped a lot.</p>
        
        <img src="../img/docs/bike-commute-blogs/part-ten/matt-allbirds.JPG" alt="shoes-and-shoes" id="matt-allbirds"class="zoomE">
            <script src="../../../js/pictFullscreen.js"></script>
        <blockquote>My allbirds and my new shoes</blockquote>
        
        <p>This was my other riding shoes, and they were some amazingly comfortable Allbirds.</p>
        
        
        <h2>Only a few mishaps</h2>
        <p>I have only had a few mishaps while riding. I've popped three tires, I had to get two new tires, I broke my chain guard, and eaten so many cliff bars.</p>
        
        
        <h2>Next Ride</h2>
        <p>I don't really know when my next ride is going to be. We do have a stationary bike in our basement. So, I might be ridding that some more as I won't be ridding in the cold. But I might start commuting again in March? That's so far away, so I might need to figure out some timing and how to ride the stationary bike before I leave for work. I then again, will need to ride once I get home, but I'm not sure.</p>
        
        
        
        <h2>Thank you All!</h2>
        <p>Thank you all for reading all of these Bike Commute Blogs, this has been a lot of fun and I've done exactly what I wanted to do!</p>
