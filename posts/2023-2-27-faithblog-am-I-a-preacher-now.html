        <h2>What Counts as a "Preacher"?</h2>
        <p>So, as of today, February 27, 2023 I have preached 3 times! Below are those sermons. Watch at your own risk..</p>

        <h2>I Love Preaching</h2>
        <p>I do, I really do! I am a big bundle of nerves when it comes time to preach, but it is so much fun. I am not a theologian by any capacity, and I've not had any classes focusing in theology. I started my preaching path in 2013 with a Youth Sunday where I got to Preach! Then, almost 10 years later, our church was going back through the Book of Matthew again, and the chapter that I preached on was up again and our pastors asked if I'd preach again - the sermon that I did nearly 10 years ago, and I did!</p>
    
        <h2>2023</h2>
        <p>Then, comes 2023, I was asked to preach again, but this year I will be preaching 3 times! I'm very excited! I've already preached once this year and I preached over Ephesians 3:1-13! I may post my notes, but I may decide otherwise. Next, I'll be preaching in June then in September! I can't wait to be up there again. I don't know if my nerves will ever be less than they are before I preach each time.</p>

        <h2>I love Jesus</h2>
        <p>I am a Christian, and I'm not scared to say it and I'm not ashamed to talk about it, but I've never had much persecution based on my faith, other than people in my High School didn't ask me to come to some parties - and that doesn't really bother me at all. I've not had to deal with much more than that in my life based on my faith, and that's where I'll leave that.</p>
