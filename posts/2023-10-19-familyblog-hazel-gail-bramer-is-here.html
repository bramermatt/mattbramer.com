        <h2>Hazel Gail Bramer</h2>
        <p>October 19, 2023 - 6lb 11oz 18.5in</p>
        
        <p>My beautiful baby girl was born Thursday at 5:18pm. </p>
        
        <p>I’ll start off by saying how proud I am of Sandy. She was able to give birth to Hazel with NO EPIDURAL! Which was her plan. She is amazing and incredible and did a spectacular job, she will say otherwise. But the nurses and everyone told her what an awesome job she did. </p>
        
        <p>Second, Hazel Gail Bramer. My beautiful baby girl entered this world and has already taken it by storm. She is so beautiful. She was 6lbs 11oz and 18.5in, which was nearly a pound and 2 inches smaller than Everett when he was born, which is something new. She’s so small and so cute, very easy to hold and carry right now lol. </p>
        
        <p>Last night was our first night in our own home and SHE SLEPT GREAT! Sandy says she feels much more rested, both Hazel and Sandy got around 5 to 6 hours of sleep.Everett and I, on the other hand, got about 10 hours of sleep… lol. I didn’t do very good last night with Hazel as I should’ve.. I’ll get there. Sandy IS INCREDIBLE with Hazel.</p>
        
        <p>Hazel and I also have a position that she loves when I hold her in my arms and she cuddles up with my arm. I love it, she loves it, and she always falls asleep that way. </p>
        
        <p>I’m also LOVING this whole baby thing, having a little beautiful girl to look at and hold and kiss is so amazing. </p>
        
        <p>She is perfect. My Hazel.. my Hazy. </p>
        
        
        <p>Also, Everett LOVES Hazel. He always wants to hold her and kiss her. He’s also is having a little trouble with me holding Hazel when he wants to play with me. It’s a learning process and I’m excited for it! </p>
