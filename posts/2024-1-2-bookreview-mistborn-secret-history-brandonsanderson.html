<h2>Written Review</h2>
<p>This is absolutely an incredible entry into the Mistborn universe! I needed this, I've been feeling pretty down on the entirety of Era Two and this has saved the entire thing for now. But, this is technically apart of Era One... who knows, I've really enjoyed Mistborn: Secret History!</p>

<p>Kelsier, the Cognitive Realm, SECRETS! AHH, this is incredible! Oh wow this was exactly what I wanted. Oh my goodness. So much goodness here. Wow, I really like Kelsier now. I loved this story. I really appreciated how the… well secret history tied into the entire story of the Cosmere. Wow!</p>
    
<p>I’ve always been a fan of a story with different realms connected, and the Cosmere is the reason why I’ve loved that story device. This is a story… ah you’ll just have to RAFO. Such implications for the wider Cosmere, I LOVE IT!</p>
    
<p>Characters were great here, this was only 150 pages and it was a great length. You got what you needed out of the story, I probably could’ve had more and enjoyed it just the same. This was an expertly paced novella. </p>
    
<p>The worldbuilding is bar-none. Brandon Sanderson has done it again. The plot is quick and also EXPANSIVE! So good!</p>
    
<p>This was the perfect novella to read after The Bands of Mourning. I can’t wait to read The Lost Metal. </p>

<h2>Started Reading</h2>
