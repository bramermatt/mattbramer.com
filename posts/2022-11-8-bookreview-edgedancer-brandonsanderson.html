        <h2>Written Review</h2>
                <p><em>This book is an amazing SHORT story of Lift, the Edgedancer, and Nale, the Skybreaker Herald of Justice, and the everstorm.</em></p>
                

                <h2>Spoilers Ahead</h2>
                <details>
                    <summary>Spoilers!</summary>
                
                <h2>Lift</h2>
                <p>An amazing character of the Knight Radiant Order of Edgedancers! I didn't know much of any Edgedancers before this book. Lift is a character that is so caring, she is young and wants to help people. She is funny and exciting, she is caring, and smart. Brandon is really good at writing women, at least to my understanding (as I'm not a women).</p>
                
                <h2>Edgedancing</h2>
                <p>This is a magic system that I find intersting. I appreciate the ingenuity of the magic system. Edgedancers even get a.. <a href="#wyndle">#wyndle</a>.</p>
                
                <h2>From Edgedancer Coppermind - <a href="https://coppermind.net/wiki/Order_of_Edgedancers" target="_blank">Order of Edgedancers</a></h2>
                <p>The Order of Edgedancers is an order of the Knights Radiant on Roshar. The Edgedancers were Surgebinders who used the Surges of Abrasion and Progression, and they are associated with the diamond polestone. They bond cultivationspren.</p>
                
                <h2>More from Edgedancer Coppermind</h2>
                <p>The Edgedancers use the Surges of <strong>Abrasion</strong> and <strong>Progression</strong>. Lift's ability to metabolize food into Lifelight is an unique exception relating to the Old Magic and not a standard ability of Edgedancers.</p>
                
                <h2>Abrasion</h2>
                <p>Abrasion grants them the ability to manipulate friction. They can apply this in different ways. In close range combat, this ability can make them hard to be stopped or grabbed. When used to decrease wind friction and friction on feet, they can travel long distances at considerable speeds, though keeping balance without friction requires a lot of practicing. They have been described, poetically, as being able "to ride the thinnest rope at speed, dance across rooftops, and move through a battlefield like a ribbon on the wind."</p>
                
                <h2>Progression</h2>
                <p>Progression allows them to make plants or other organic objects grow much faster than normal. They can also heal, and although the extent of this ability is unknown, it seems that the wielder is even able to heal others from wounds suffered from Shardblades.</p>

                <h2>Wyndle</h2>
                <p><a href="https://coppermind.net/wiki/Wyndle" target="_blank">Wyndle Coppermind Article</a></p>
                
                <p>The Cultivation Spren that is a vine, but also a Shardblade! I am beginning to understand that the different orders of Knights Radiants all have Shardblades. Wyndle is fun and caring as well. He is smart, and a seemingly fun spren.</p>
                
                <p>When Wydnle became the Shardblade rod for Lift, it was so hype! I didn't know what Nale was going to do to Lift. But I will never get over the Stormlight stories of Radiants that get their own Shardblade from their spren.</p>
                
                
                <h2>Nale</h2>
                <p>The Herald of Justice, this was a great story of Nale. He was terrifying but the ending really shows the ability for people to grow in their understand and it be better than they were before. I'm excited to see what happens next with Nale.</p>
                
                
                <h2>Stormlight Implications</h2>
                <p>I didn't expect Lift to come into the Stormlight Archive as much someone like Kaladin, who is a main character of the Stormlight Archive. But I'm so excited to see more Radiants on screen at once...</p>

                <h2>Score</h2>
                <p>5/5 is there even a question? This book was incredible. Brandon Sanderson is incredible.</p>
