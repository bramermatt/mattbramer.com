                <h2>Written Review</h2>
                
                <p>This has been one of the most impactful books I've ever read. Not just the Wheel of Time, but in the fantasy genre. This is an incredible ending to the Wheel of Time. I couldn't have asked for a better ending. You will be TIRED after reading this book. You will have to grab tissues, and you'll have to make sure you have some hydration as you read. Why? Because when you start reading this book, you won't be able to stop.</p>
                
                <p>This book is action-PACKED! I'd say this book is 95% action. You are on such a high for 95% of this book, the last 5% you have to hold on TIGHT. You might struggle at points, but you ARE IN FOR A TREAT!</p>
                
                <p>I think, and I've said it before, Brandon Sanderson was perfect to complete this series. Now, Brandon has said that Robert Jordan had written the ending to these books YEARS ago. Brandon has also said that RJ had written the epilogue with very little touched by Brandon.</p>
                
                <p>Since Brandon has taken over, the magic system has been more deeply integrated - if that was even possible. Robert Jordan, in his passing, left Brandon such a well developed story - in my eyes. Robert Jordan is a master in story telling. Brandon Sanderson is a master in story telling.</p>
                
                <p>Also, I love Perrin now. He has become one of my favorite characters since The Gathering Storm. If only he had been this incredible in books 5-12.</p>
                
                <p>I can't believe I finished The Wheel of Time... wow.</p>
                
                <p>For those wondering, I've done a full <a href="../pages/wheel-of-time-in-review.html">Wheel of Time in Review</a>! Please check out all my reviews there!</p>

                        <article>
                        <p>To do this book justice.. this is going to be difficult. </p>
                
                <p>This book starts on a bang, Trollocs invading Caemlyn from the ending of TOM. And here begins our Trollocs battle. And that won't stop until page 970. Does that sound like a lot? YES. BUT! YOU WILL NOT BE TIRED OF THEM BY THEN. Holy smokes. I was struggling at the beginning of this book because of the Trollocs, because they were EVERYWHERE. You'd go over here and they were there, you'd go over there and they were there.</p>
                
                <p>But we are DEEP in the Last Battle. And GOOD GRACIOUS! The Last Battle in this book is 216 pages, one chapter. An INCREDIBLY EPIC BATTLE, like hard to describe actually. But there are over 50 perspectives.. 50 perspectives. But I'm jumping ahead of myself.</p>
                
                <p>A couple standout characters here that surprised me.. Perrin, Androl, Olver, and Birgitte. Perrin has come up a lot in the last books, as I've said, and he is just AWESOME in this book!  </p>
                
                <h2>Let's dive in. </h2>
                <p>Thank you to {<a href="https://dragonmount.com/books/memory_of_light/summary/" target="_blank">Book Summary: A Memory of Light - Dragonmount</a>} for the helpful summaries here.</p>
                
                <p>The war begins on four fronts. Elayne and Bashere lead Andorans against the Trolloc army in Caemlyn. Agelmar and the Borderlander armies support Lan’s forces at Tarwin’s Gap. Gareth Bryne and Egwene face an army in Kandor. Ituralde and the Aiel will lead the forces at Shayol Ghul in defense of Rand. Faile is placed in charge of supplies and entrusted with the Horn of Valere.</p>
                
                <p>At the Black Tower, Androl and Pevara bond one another and lead the infiltration in the Black Tower to save Logain, eventually driving out Taim and the Dreadlords that were being Turned to the Shadow.</p>
                
                <p>Perrin and Gaul have Rand help them travel to Tel’aran’rhiod in the flesh to hunt Slayer. Rand arrives at Shayol Ghul and enters the cave. Perrin and the wolves save him from Slayer. Perrin also discovers Compulsion is being used to manipulate the four great captains commanding the forces of the Light. Egwene and the Aes Sedai army in Kandor are overrun when Demandred arrives with all the forces of Shara. They are eventually reinforced by the arrival of the Seanchan. Similarly, Bashere leads Elayne’s army into a trap outside Cairhien, but they are saved by Logain, Androl, and the Black Tower.</p>
                
                <p>Mat takes control of all the armies of the Light and prepares a final stand at the Fields of Merrilor. But Faile, Olver, and the Horn are lost in the Blight.</p>
                
                <p>Rand duels Moridin, then faces the Dark One with conflicting possible futures outside of the Pattern while the Final Battle rages. During the prolonged battle, Demandred duels Gawyn and kills him, then wounds Galad, while dueling Mat’s army. </p>
                
                <p>Losses in battle also include Rhuarc, Siuan, Bryne, Birgitte, and more. Mat sends the Seanchan away in a feigned retreat. Egwene defeats Taim and the Dreadlords with a new weave, the Flame of Tar Valon, which saves the Pattern from the damage of balefire. Lan duels Demandred and finally kills the Forsaken commander. At the same time, the return of the Seanchan and Olver blowing the Horn of Valere turns the tide and they defeat the army of the Shadow and the Sharans.</p>
                
                <p>Logain breaks the seals and Rand baits Moridin into using Callandor. Rand then uses saidin, saidar, and the True Power to build a new, perfect prison for the Dark One. In the final stage of battle, Perrin protect Rand by killing Slayer and Cyndane. Then Mat arrives and destroys Padan Fain.</p>
                
                <p>Rand is believed to have died of his wounds after the battle and a funeral pyre is lit. Aviendha, Elayne, and Min know he survived in Moridin’s body as he rides away in secret, unable to channel but still affecting the Pattern directly.</p>
                
                <h2>My Thoughts</h2>
                <p><strong>Rand</strong> This was an incredibly flawless ending to this series. Rand going off in the sunset, being able to hide. Rand doing this body-swap with Moridin, because of the balefire crossing in POD, I have been thinking about the balefires crossing since then and it comes to fruition here. Rand also lighting the pipe.. I agree with Brandon Sanderson’s thoughts, that Rand being so intwined with the Pattern - he can just manifest things now. How powerful! </p>
                
                <p><strong>Egwene</strong> I’d been spoiled on Egwene’s death a long time ago. However, her death scene was still so impactful. From TFOH, I’d fallen in love with Egwene. And from TGS she has become just incredible and every scene she’s on the page in itching for more. So her death, while sacrificing herself was perfect. </p>
                
                <p><strong>Nynaeve</strong> To think about Nynaeve, specifically in AMOL, is difficult. But also the question is brought up, what did Moiraine do here besides be there? Nynaeve, we’ve heard is the most powerful female channeler that has been for over 1,000 years. But in this book, she stood next to Rand in Shayol Ghul, then Linked with Rand. Then gave Alanna some herbs as a great Wisdom would do. But what else? Nynaeve was one of my favorites for a VERY LONG TIME! I’m not upset, there was so much more that occurred in this book. Just a thought. </p> 
                
                <p><strong>Mat</strong> Son of Battles! Oh man Mat, this was INCREDIBLE! I loved everything Mat here. </p>
                
                <p><strong>Perrin</strong> Oh Perrin, I’ve gushed over you this review and I can’t stop. YOU ARE SO POWERFUL and so AWESOME! I apologize that it took me this long to realize. You’re amazing. TAR is yours. Also, I’m really glad Faile was alive.</p>
                
                <p><strong>Olver</strong> Olver blew the Horn of Valere! That is awesome! </p>
                
                <p><strong>Gawyn</strong> People have blown Gawyn out of proportion, in my humble opinion. He put on the bloodknife rings and ran to kill Damandred. He got himself killed and Egwene was shaken to her core, but that didn't really do much. This wasn't too big of a deal to me.</p>
                
                <p><strong>The New Seal on the Dark One's Prison</strong> Logain breaks the seals and Rand baits Moridin into using Callandor. Rand then uses saidin, saidar, and the True Power to build a new, perfect prison for the Dark One. This was awesome. For the whole battle with Rand and the DO throughout the entirety of this book, I was impressed with this realization. Does this mean the DO is sealed forever.. I think so!</p>

                 <h2>Header</h2>
                 <p>And the Shadow fell upon the Land, and the World was riven stone from stone. The oceans fled, and the mountains were swallowed up, and the nations were scattered to the eight corners of the World. The moon was as blood, and the sun was as ashes. The seas boiled, and the living envied the dead. All was shattered, and all but memory lost, and one memory above all others, of him who brought the Shadow and the Breaking of the World. And him they named Dragon. —from Aleth nin Taerin alta Camora,The Breaking of the World. Author unknown, the Fourth Age.</p>
                 
                 <h2>Prologue, By Grace and Banners Fallen, Wheel</h2>
                 <p><strong>Baryd.</strong> Oh what a start. Oh yes. Give me more! Baryd is the personal guard to Jarid Sarand, Elenia's husband. Jarid won't listen to reason and his camp gives up on him. They tie him to a tree to keep him from messing with Elayne. The camp heads north to fight for Andor at the Last Battle. Then ghosts move through the camp. Also, they're in the middle of a bubble of evil where the metal becomes soft. Wow.</p>
                 
                 <p><strong>Talmanes.</strong> Of course Elayne doesn't know... she's at the Field of Merrilor. Oh no. Talmanes feels sympathy for the commoners since spending time with Mat. His mission is to save the dragons. Sandip reports that mercenary bands aren't helping. Trollocs are attempting to block the gates. Whoa! </p> 
                 
                 <p><strong>Isam.</strong> Okay, wow, new things here. Isam is in the inn in the Town, where he grew up. This is in the Blight near Thakan'dar and Shayol Ghul. Those red veiled people are Samma N'Sei, Eye Blinders. I'm a little confused but they kill Talentless, is that channeling - do you have Talent if you can channel? They're scared of Moridin, he killed 12 of them. Ahh, gotta by Cyndane that came in to talk to Isam. She wants Isam to kill Rand. He is to take no orders from anyone but the DO. </p>
                 
                 <p>Isam sees a couch go by with thirteen women and thirteen Myrddraal.. they've turned someone to the Dark! Two Eye Blinders are going to accompany Isam. Their veils are down and he can see their teeth are files to points. </p>
                
                 <p><strong>Talmanes.</strong> Oh no, Talmanes! He's been cut by a Thakan'dar blade.. and it's gone black! He is recuriting some mercs to help.. it's the bloody Last Battle! </p>
                 
                 <p><strong>Leilwin.</strong> Hmm, I think I agree with Nynaeve here. Leilwin / Egeanin and Bayle are at the Field of Merrilor - she wants to give herself to the White Tower as da'covale. But the White Tower doesn't do that. Leilwin gave that a'dam to Suroth and nearly destroyed the world - Semi > Rand > True Power (TGS 22). Man, hmm. </p> 
                 
                 <p><strong>Talmanes.</strong> Oh RJ/BS are you toying with me. Give me Talmanes' death or let him live. Melten is helping Talmanes with his wound. Talmanes misses Vanin. Dennel, one of the dragons camptains, has a map where the dragons are. They plan to go to the Palace. Trollocs are nearby - they head toward the Palace. </p>
                  
                 <p><strong>Aviendha.</strong> Well this makes me happy. Aviendha being accepted into the Wise Ones as a Wise One. Love it! Bair is also smart, change the name of one of your children and we'll see if all is the same. Avi also asks about Nakomi, but Bair says that it is an ancient name.. what could that mean!?! Avi makes a gateway for Bair to go to Rhuidean through the glass columns. WOO! </p>
                  
                 <p><strong>Talmanes.</strong> Let's do it Talmanes.. SAVE THE CITY, SAVE THE PALACE. LET'S GO! The Trollocs have taken the walls, the Band still holds the gates. Talmanes has to save the dragons, Guybon will come with him! LET'S GOOOOOO! </p>
                  
                 <p><strong>Androl.</strong> Here we go. Androl in the Black Tower. Pevara suggests practicing a circle as an advantage against Taim. Androl says he is one of the weakest in the BT. They agree to follow Androl until Logain returns. He has to think of a plan. </p>
                 
                 <p><strong>Talmanes.</strong> Talmanes might have just jumped up to one of my fav side characters lol. "oh, the cut, i'm dying, unfortnuatly. Terribly tragic, you wouldn't happen to have any brandy?" YES! Alright, another cut by a Fade, and Talmanes killed it and another Trolloc - he's awesome. Aludra is there with a lot of townspeople. They have the dragons! </p>
                  
                 <p><strong>Moghedien.</strong> Well good lord, that was a LOT! Moghedien is in Moirdin's dreamshard.. that's new. She has her own mindtrap now, so she can channel without permissions. Moridin still has Cyndane's / Lanfear's. Moiridin visited Sindhol (that word wasn't explained but that would I assume be the world of the Aelfinn and Eelfinn.) Moiridin rescued Lanfear then killed her so the DO could give her a new body and name. Demandred comes. Then Hessalam, Graendal in a new body. Moridin then brings Taim in.. as a NEW CHOSEN! HOLY CRAP! M'Hael. He was raised because he has been successful in creating a new generation of Dreadlords - I KNEW IT! I called this sometime ago I think. Mogi is to help Demandred by watching over one of the armies. Also, apparenlty Demandred has met Taim before. WHOA! </p>
                  
                 <p><strong>Talmanes.</strong> I would love a visual for this because.. what? They're cornered and Talmanes calls for then shooting the dragons at the Trollocs, but they blow up a wall? Talmanes then falls unconscious. So, probably not dead. </p>
                  
                 <h2>Ch 1, Eastward the Wind Blew, The Blight</h2>
                 <p><strong>Rand.</strong> Boy, I'm going to cry. This is so so so good. </p>
                 
                 <p>Wind rises in the Mountains of Mist.. Taren Ferry.. People look north to the Last Battle. The end has come. Rand is laughing with Perrin about the Two Rivers. Rand was awakend by his dreams. Rand has KING LAMAN'S SWORD!!! WHOA! Smiths are working with the AM to make more Power-Wrought weapons - Maidens want spears! LTT doesn't know how to reseal the Bore, Rand has an idea. what could that be?! An earthquake happens. Rand is worried about the LB but he is unafraid! Rand can't believe he is goin got be a father. Elayne has been woken up - probably because Caemlyn is on fire. </p>
                 
                 <p><strong>Egwene.</strong> GIVE ME MORE! OH THIS IS SO GOOD. Egwene was writing a letter to Rand.. they Travel to Elayne's tent. Egwene wants to convince Rand not to break the seals. They searched the RJ statue library but found nothing useful. </p>
                  
                 <p>There was a quote form the Karaethon Cycle (Doniella Alievin's copy of the Termendal translation): And light shall fail, and dawn shall not come, and still the captive rails. His blood shall give us the Light. Wait upon the Light.. Egwene thinks Rand must break the seals, but at the right time. </p>
                 
                 <p>A messenger arrives and tells Elayne about Caemlyn, Nynaeve is exhausted after Healing Talmanes with a burst of the Power, all five. (Min's Viewing). Leilwin bows to Egwene - Egwene has them held by Tower Guards. Egwene Links with Nynaeve to help with Healing. </p>
                 
                 <p><strong>Rand.</strong> Yep, this is a good book! Perrin is a good leader, Rand is set on breaking th seals and can explain it very nicely to Perrin - but Egwene isn't a blacksmith. Rand believes the Caemlyn attack is Demandred. Also, Aviendha is nearby as well! </p>
                  
                 <p>Perrin wonders how the Trollocs entered Caemlyn. Rand says via Waygate. They cannot survive Traveling. Only gholam can, and Aginor only made a few. Perrin says they have to do something about Caemlyn. Otherwise, they will have the Trollocs at their backs. Rand says it is just the sort of tactic Demandred would use.  Rand thinks it is ironic that the Dark One's taint is what brought on Lews Therin's memories which will ultimately lead to the Dark One's downfall. The last time Lews Therin's destroyed them. This time, Rand's will save them.</p>
                 
                 <h2>Ch 2, The Choice of an Ajah, Dragon's Fang</h2>
                 <p><strong>Pevara.</strong> HAHAHAHAHA. Androl and Pevara were so scared they bonded each other...hahahaha. They tried Linking, it worked, and then boom. double bonding! hahaha. Evin returns and says Welyn is.. one of them - Taim's. Logain and Taim have reconciled.. interesting. Could it be true?? Heck, could Logain be Demandred? hah probs not - I have no evidence lol. </p>
                
                 <p><strong>Aviendha.</strong> Oh this was a funny chapter, Avi is a beast, sneaking through the entire camp just to talk to Elayne.</p>
                  
                 <p>Elayne explains that the Waygate was heavily guarded with both Avendesora leaves on the outside but a dozen of them were Darkfriends despite publicly rejecting Gaebril and seeming loyal. Birgitte is watching the city looking for ways to force the Trollocs to leave. Elayne will return to Andor after the meeting, but Aviendha must stay with her people. She has been to Rhuidean and is now a Wise One. A messenger arrives with a letter from Rand. It encourages her to return to Caemlyn, obviously a Daes Dae'mar-style ruse to anger her and make her stay. She still does not know Rand's plan, only that it involves all the rulers. She will certainly stay for the meeting. Aviendha must go to Rand. Elayne sends for Min so the three of them can talk first.</p>
                
                 <h2>Ch 3, A Dangerous Place, Dragon</h2>
                <p><strong>Androl.</strong> Oh man, there is NOTHING these boys can do against Taim and his men. That was tough to read. Now I really care about Androl and want him to be safe. He's been demoted - also I don't for a second believe Rand said any of this, it's all Taim. Androl says they must have Logain hidden somewhere in the BT and they will find him and rescue him, tonight. Let's go! </p>
                
                 <p><strong>Rand.</strong> Ha. Rand is no longer sick seizing saidin, nice! He wants to learn Healing form Flinn. Tam is wil Perrin's camp. Avi, Min, and Elayne are now first-sisters. Avi and Rand aren't going to get much sleep tonight, the Maidens are shouting at them lol. </p>
                
                 <p><strong>Pevara.</strong> Yikes that was almost bad. Androl and Pevara are hiding in a storeroom. They think there is a ter'angreal stopping Traveling, yes actually it's a dreamspike! Dobser, one of Taim's, comes in and they shield him and tie him up with Air, then boom, two more Taim's men come in. Welyn and Leems. Eventually Androl knocks them out but not after Pevara nearly got them both down with Air and Shields. Androl is amazed and Pevara reminds him what the Reds trained for.</p>
                   
                 <p>While they wait for Emarin and the others, he tends to her head as he tells her the story of apprenticing to a Wise Woman in Mayene after he could not save a friend Sayer from a fever.</p>
                
                 <h2>Ch 4, Advantages to a Bond, Dragon's Fang</h2>
                 <p><strong>Androl.</strong> Dude, I am pumped we are getting so much talk of Turning. The thirteen Aes Sedai and thirteen Myddraal - how did they get snuck into the BT?? Also, they've got Logain?! NOOO! How do you reverse the Turning? Can you?! SO MANY QUESTIONS! Emarin is smart, this was great. Also, sad story about Androl's dad - killing himself.</p>  
                 
                 <p>Androl thinks the men who have been Turned are really dead. Their bodies have new, evil souls. Dobser swallows the story and confirms that Taim now has Logain. Logain is taking a long time to Turn because of his strong will. Dobser tells them where Logain and the others are held in underground rooms. With the information in hand, Pevara ties up Dobser again. Androl says they will gather Nalaam, Canler, Evin and Jonneth then wait for Taim to finish with Logain and then rescue him.</p>
                 
                 <p><strong>Rand.</strong> Good gracious, this is AWESOME. Give me more answers to all the questions I've ever had in this series. WHOA!  Rand wakes in Moiridin's, I guess I can say Elan's dreamshard. Gosh, so cool we get the explanations for all those times in the early books. Wow. so cool. </p>
                  
                 <p>It does not feel exactly like Tel'aran'rhiod so it must be a dreamshard. He set wards so he wonders how he was pulled in. He feels a presence and addresses the man as Elan. Elan addresses him as Lews Therin. He still wears his new body as Moridin. Moridin says he does not know how Rand is pulled into his dream. The Pattern pulls them together. </p>
                
                 <p>Rand says he knows about Mierin. Moridin is furious that he knows and thinks she must have come to him. He has mixed emotions about Mierin, Lanfear, Selene. She tried to kill Egwene and Aviendha. Mierin being alive makes him hope for Moiraine. Moridin says her name is now Cyndane and that she hates Rand for what happened. Rand remembers Ishamael pulling him into dreams.</p>
                 
                 <p>Moridin continues to taunt Rand, but Rand says he is finished with Moridin. It is now between him and the Dark One. Moridin also mentions Weiramon and how Rand listened for heartbeats, smart! Rand is using all his will to make this place come back to life - clouds disappear and everything blooms. Moridin disappears and Rand returns to his body for sleep. </p>
                
                 <p><strong>Pevara.</strong> Yep, the second they went underground, I was worried about the ceiling collapsing! lol. Logain! He's safe! Forkrooted it seems, but safe! Androl and Pevara (great duo!) Androl is awesome. Jonneth (two rivers) also awesome. Taim is outside. They've got to find a way out!</p>
                   
                 <h2>Ch 5, To Require a Boon, Aiel</h2>
                 <p><strong>Rand.</strong> It's the day Rand is to break the seals. Rand and Avi take a shower with the Power lol. Avi tells him that she will ask a boon of him today. </p>
                
                <p><strong>Egwene.</strong> WHAT A MIC DROP! "Moiraine entered the tent". OH OH OH! Also, Rand thought Roedran was Demandred lol. </p>
                
                <p>Holy smokes, this was awesome. Rand and LITERALLY EVERY SINGLE NOBLE IN THE WORLD MEETING (minus a few... seanchan stuff lol). Rand has a document in place, "the Dragon's Peace". </p>
                 
                <p>Rand requires: country boundaries set, rules of engagement, plans for schools, then he wants to break the seals, then he wants to lead every army. He also wants to kill the DO. I truly don't know what is going to happen lol. Also, there is a faint crackling sound outside and the sunlight dims, what is happening with that?! </p>
                
                 <h2>CH 6, A Knack, Staff</h2>
                 <p><strong>Perrin.</strong> Awesome, awesome awesome! Perrin sees an image of Mat with something in his hands. Everyone is excited to see Moiraine - Nynaeve gives her a hug. I CRIED. AT WORK. AT MY DESK when Moiraine told Rand, "the Wheel weaves as the Wheel wills." AHHH. LOVE IT. Moiraine is awesome. I'm so happy I read NS right before this. </p>
                 
                 <p>Egwene tells Moiraine about Rand's plan with the Dragon's Peace and Moiraine responds by quoting different parts of the Karaethon Prophecies, stopping by each person who represents that part of the prophecy. A Brown notes that the Seanchan are excluded and Elayne notes that there's no way to settle disputes. Rand agrees to get the Seanchan to sign it or the document is void. Aviendha then requests her boon, which is to include the Aiel. Perrin comes up with the idea of making the Aiel the enforcers of the peace and mediators of disputes.</p>
                
                 <p>Rand suggests that they all agree on Elayne to lead the battle and the rulers agree. Rand agrees to visit the Seanchan after the document is signed. The Aiel will not fight them. Rand will hold the Seanchan to the lands that they currently have and they'll all deal with the captives later. Rand is also on a mission to save a friend.. </p>
                
                 <p><strong>Lan.</strong> Oh, also glad I read NS before.. the hemlet! Seems to me like Rand's friend was Lan! He has sent thousands to help Lan. </p>
                
                 <p>Lan's forces retreat for several hundred yards and then turn around. The Trollocs start charging and then Lan's forces start charging back towards them. A dozen gateways open and Lan's charge becomes a hundred thousand. Asha'man start attacking, killing the front rank of Trollocs. Before leaving for the camp, Andere says he wants to see Lan smile. Lan not only smiles, but laughs and tells Jophil to raise the banner high.</p>
                
                 <h2>Ch 7, Into the Thick of It, Tree</h2>
                 <p><strong>Elayne.</strong> So Rand "created" dozens of great trees like in a Stedding? They grew full height within five minutes.. that was the light dimming inside. People can still channel. Rand walking into the grove and disappeared. </p>
                 
                 <p>OH THE FOUR GREAT CAPTAINS YES YES YES! Bryne, Agelmar, Bashere, Ituralde. YES YES YES! They finally decide that their main attack will be at Caemlyn while just holding the Gap and stopping the Trollocs from going further than Kandor. Agelmar Jagad will command the forces at the Gap, Bryne, with the help of Aes Sedai, will command the forces at Kandor, Davram Bashere will command the forces at Caemlyn and Ituralde, with the help of the Aiel, will command the forces at Shayol Ghul. Elayne asks Perrin to be in charge of logistics of the Merrilor camp, setting up a Traveling ground and organizing the channelers.</p>
                
                <p>YES YES YES YES. OGIER. HORN OF VALERE. YES YES YES YES. Freaking YES! I was wondering about the Horn. Let's gooooooo. </p> 
                 
                <p>Birgitte walks up to Elayne and then they stop and listen to a faint song being sung. They keep going and find a group of three dozen Ogier, including Loial, putting their hands on the giant trees and singing. After the song ends, one of the Ogier introduces himself as Haman son of Dal son of Morel and he tells Elayne that all of the Ogier have come to fight for them. Loial's mother, tells her that the Ogier discussed whether to fight with them or just stayed out of it. Loial's mother also tells her that she argued for not fighting in order for the strongest argument for fighting to be made. Loial tells Perrin that he is now married to Erith.</p>
                
                 
                <p>Elayne pulls Perrin and Faile aside and tells Perrin that she wants him to be her coordinator of all stores and rations for the whole army. Perrin tells her that he must be free to help Rand and Faile then volunteers to take on that role. Elayne adds on that the Horn must also safely get to Mat and they were planning to do by using the supply runs to hide it. Elayne is hesitant to give this role to Faile since she does not know her that well, but Perrin notes that the darkfriends will be expecting Elayne to use someone trusted to move the Horn.</p>
                 
                <p><strong>Lan.</strong> This book, so far, is hype moment after hype moment. WOW. King Easar bows to Lan. Everyone will follow Lan's lead in the fight in the Borderlands. Five Asha'man are there, each one from a different Borderland country. HYPE!</p>
                 
                <h2>Ch 8, That Smoldering City, Lion</h2>
                <p><strong>Elayne.</strong> An impressive plan. I like it.</p>
                
                <p>Elayne is on Moonshadow and a safe distance away from Caemlyn but where she can still see the city. She notes to herself that she hadn't ruled Caemlyn for a hundred days yet, but already the city was lost. Talmanes can't give a good estimate of Trollocs in the city, so he says there's probably tens of thousands, but not hundreds of thousands.</p> 
                
                <p>Birgitte rides up and gives the all-ready sign. Elayne says "Burn it" and Birgitte gives the signal for the Kin to open gateways so that lit torches can be thrown into the oil-filled basements. While waiting, Elayne tells Birgitte to tell the camp that she carries the Dragon Reborn's children.</p>
                
                <p><strong>Androl.</strong> Holy smokes! Also, I am not firm on Logain being Demandred lol. That would be neat, but I don't think that is the case. </p>
                  
                <p>Androl wakes up to find himself tied up next to Jonneth Dowtry and Emarin. Pevara is also tied up somewhere nearby. They are all shielded. Evin is also tied up nearby, weeping. He admits to Androl that they broke him. Atal Mishraile approaches Androl and tells him that he will enjoy killing him for what happened to Coteren. Androl sees Mezar Kurin and Welyn Kajima drag Logain into the room. Taim tells the two to take Evin next. Androl tries to convince Taim to take him instead, but Taim tells him he's not worth turning.</p>
                
                <p>Evin comes back a few minutes later, obviously turned. Androl asks him where Arlen Nalaam is and Evin tells him he died in the cave-in. Thirteen Fades come in and take Emarin away.</p>
                 
                <h2>Ch 9, To Die Well, Heron</h2>
                <p><strong>Lan.</strong> Lan selfish? Bulen dead. Agelmar mentions retreat and Lan.. he agrees. </p>
                  
                <p>Bulen falls from his horse and Lan rushes over only to find him dead from a massive wound in his side that he had been hiding from Lan. Lan lifts Bulen's corpse and places it across the saddle of Bulen's horse. Andere and Prince Kaisel are watching solemnly nearby. Lan tells everyone he will not mourn Bulen but will cheer him because he died well. He then tells the story of Bakh, who also died well. This spurs Prince Kaisel to tell the story about Ragon and Andere to tell the story of Kragil, which spurs the rest of the camp to start telling stories. Lan finds Narishma, who is holding a gateway open for a supply cart, and ask him to find a cold place to store Bulen's body. Narishma closes his gateway and open another onto a mountain top. Lan take Bulen's body and places it there and removes Bulen's hadori and wraps it around the hilt of his sword.</p>
                 
                <p><strong>Egwene.</strong> Egwene and Gawyn are marrie dnow. </p> 
                 
                <p>Silviana rides up and tells Egwene that Elayne wants just one stationary hospital instead of several smaller ones at each battlefield. Gawyn agrees that it would be more efficient and secure. Egwene agrees with this and tells Silviana to tell Romanda to gather all of the Yellow Ajah, not at the White Tower, but perhaps Mayene instead. Egwene also tells Silviana to tell Elayne all of this as well.</p>
                 
                <p>Egwene and Gawyn head to the command camp and find Chubain in charge of setup. The plan for Kandor was to harrass the Trolloc forces in the valleys, with archers on the hilltops. Chubain leads them to Egwene's tent where Leilwin and Bayle Domon sit guarded by three Tower Guard. Leilwin pledges herself to the Amyrlin. Egwene accepts this and then tells Leilwin to tell her everything she knows about the Seanchan.</p>
                 
                <p><strong>Rand.</strong> Oh very beautiful, such a lovely scene. Rand gives Elayne a Seed, which is an objected created to draw your Power and instill it into something else, it's not an angreal but helps create an angreal... whoa! She gives Rand the dagger ter'angreal that makes the Shadow unable to see him.</p>
                
                <h2>Ch 10, The Use of Dragons, Lion</h2>
                <p><strong>Elayne.</strong> So, Birgitte, is she going to do anything? She is just kind of there. I look forward to seeing what she does in the LB. That might be why she's here, but she's been here since book five and well, she's just kind of been around. Am I the only one thinking that?</p>
                 
                <p>She then sees Uno and stops Moonshadow so that she can talk with him. Uno tries not to swear, but Elayne tells him not to worry as Nynaeve is not around. He tells her that Kandor is in bad shape and that he wants to get back there soon as to not miss any of the fighting. He then heads towards the Travelling ground. Elayne feels Birgitte looking at him in a certain way as he's leaving and tells her that there's not time for that.</p>
                
                 
                <p>They arrive back at the command pavillion where Bashere, Abell Cauthon, Gallenne and Trom are conferring. Bashere reports that Kandor refugees are flocking to the Aes Sedai, including many fighting men. Ituralde is still waiting on Rand before moving on to Shayol Ghul and the Borderlanders are holding the Gap but they're considering a controlled retreat. It's clear to Elayne that they need to get the Trollocs at Caemlyn to charge them sooner rather than later in order to finish that battle and redistribute the soldiers to other battles.</p>
                 
                <p><strong>Androl.</strong> Okay, this disc in Taim's pouch.. a Seal?? Can't be. This is awesome, all this talk of Turning. Also, what is Taim about to do? Remove the dreamspike??</p> 
                 
                <p>Emarin is nearby. He has not been Turned yet, but he seems close to breaking. The thirteen men that Taim had been using for it are exhausted and Taim is angry at them. Pevara had also been given the tea and is knocked out, which also angered Taim because he wanted to Turn her next.</p>
                 
                <p>Abors and Mishraile pull Toveine Gazal into the room. Abors had joined Taim willingly even before the Turning had begun. Taim orders his men to Turn Toveine next, but his attention is on a disc in his hands. Taim puts the disc in a pounch and tells Mishraile to come with him and that "it's time."</p>
                 
                <p><strong>Lan.</strong> DREADLORDS! The Gap has been lost. Lan tells Narishma to go to Elayne and bring back channelers to cover their retreat.</p>  
                 
                <p><strong>Elayne.</strong> The dragons worked!</p>  
                 
                <p>Elayne arrives at the roadway just as several Fades lead the Trollocs onto the road further down. The Band of the Red Hand has setup nearly one hundred dragons in four ranks across the roadway. Talmanes is atop a pile of boxes overlooking everything. Talmanes gives the order and then rank after rank open fire on the Fades and Trollocs. When the smoke clears, thousands of Trollocs are in pieces, with no sign of the Fades at all. Even nearby trees were shattered. Elayne asks Birgitte what she thinks, and she replies that they're messy, imprecise and very effective. Birgitte says she doesn't like what this means for future battles, but Elayne says this means there won't be any more wars because of these.</p>
                 
                <h2>Ch 11, Just Another Sell Sword, Dice</h2> 
                <p><strong> Egwene.</strong> A SUPER AWESOME IDEA using gateways on the floor looking down on a battle! Also, the Aes Sedai are about to be a big force against the Shadow! </p>
                 
                <p><strong>Mat.</strong> Mat is in Ebou Dar, in an inn, the Yearly Brawl. Oh shoot, Galgan has been hiring assassin's to kill Tuon. Also, I LOVE that Mat is making up backstories now lol. They talk a little more and Kathana realizes who Mat is and that every soldier in Ebou Dar has been told to look for his face. Also Petra is a guard at the gate.</p>
                 
                <p><strong>Rand.</strong> What do they say about inevitability... it's inevitable? Also, come on with this crowning Lan - I'm running out of tissues here guys! </p>
                 
                <p>Rand is in Lan's command tent in Shienar with Moiraine. Lan and his men are retreating. Rand gives Lan two crowns, one for Lan and one for Nynaeve.. King and Queen of Malkier! Rand opens a gateway onto the battlefield. A storm begins and Rand channels and starts destroying Shadowspawn. Rand has the fat-man angreal from DW... it was in the mud. Rand yells that Taim is trying to put a shield on him and then Rand kills some Dreadlords. Then turns out there are Circles trying to shield him. He was able to stop them and realizes it's not the time yet. Then he gateways back to Lan's tent and has an idea. </p>
                 
                 
                <h2>Ch 12, A Shard of a Moment, Moon</h2>
                <p><strong>Birgitte.</strong> Oh no, has Birgitte been severed from the Horn? I guess so, I mean, she isn't in TAR. So I don't know. She an some Aiel are taking out some Trollocs. Has Birgitte lost Gaidal forever? Oh I can't wait to see the Horn again!</p>
                 
                <p><strong>Rand.</strong> AWE-SOME! Rand has created his own dreamshard! AWESOME! Lanfear is there, that's what I'll call her. Lanfear is there and she wants Rand to save her. He won't unless she opens herself to him. She won't. LTT never loved Mierin. Rand opened himself to her, showing her his intensions and desires.. a swirl of color... interesting! Rand then leaves her there. </p>
                 
                <p><strong>Perrin.</strong> Here's what I'll say. Some results take risks. Perrin entering TAR in the flesh, is a risk, I think Perrin will take. Despite what everyone will tell him. If he dies, his Thread is burned and will never retrun. I think he's going to do it. </p>
                 
                <h2>Ch 13, What Must Be Done, Lion</h2>
                <p><strong>Egwene.</strong> YEPP. GREEN AJAH = BATTLE AJAH lol. Finally we get some Green Ajah carnage, this time it's "Aes Sedai, kill". but this time it's Shadowspawn! </p>
                 
                <p>She uses Vora's Sa'angreal to destroy the oncoming Trollocs, mainly using weaves of Earth in a raw destructive manner. The Aes Sedai fighting alongside her do the same, wave after wave of Trollocs fall to weaves of the Power. Egwene thinks that the Green Ajah is living up to its name as they rain destruction down on the Shadowspawn.</p>
                  
                <p><strong>Elayne.</strong> We don't seem to be winning.</p>
                
                <p>Elayne is meeting with Bashere at her command in Braem Wood. They discuss how the other battles are going, the Borderlanders led by Lan have been pushed out of Tarwin's Gap. Elayne orders the cities of Shienar, Fal Dara, Fal Moran and Mos Shirare to be burnt and the people evacuated to Tar Valon. Talmanes enters with news of the battle in Braem Wood, the Dragons are useless as the Trollocs are keeping off the road. </p>
                   
                 
                <p>Bashere suggests they retreat, sending a group of bridge builders to the River Erinin so that they can cross into Cairhien. Bashere's advice is to retreat all the way to the city of Cairhien and fight the Shadowspawn with the city at their backs. Elayne agrees but worries that she cannot afford to keep retreating, she must defeat the Shadow here so that her troops can be of use elsewhere.</p>
                 
                <p><strong>Perrin.</strong> I AM PUMPED FOR THIS! Perrin and Gaul in the wolf dream.. which is just TAR. I had some question about that, but now that it's on the page.. they're the same. Awesome. Perrin and Gaul have entered TAR in the flesh to hunt Slayer. Also, Dain Bornhald told Perrin that Fain killed his parents. PERRIN IS GOING TO ABSOLUTE CRUSH FAIN'S SKULL WHEN HE FINDS HIM. OH MY GOSH, I CAN'T WAIT!</p>
                 
                <h2>Ch 14, Doses of Forkroot, Dragon's Fang</h2> 
                <p><strong>Perrin.</strong> Oh heck, Lanfear! Perrin and Gaul are in TAR trying to go to the BT, to stop Slayer and the dreamspike. They're there and Perrin recognizes Lanfear's scent. She tells Perrin she wants vengeance against the person who caused her imprisonment, then she looks at the sky seeming alarmed and disappears. WHAT DID SHE SEE?? The dreamspike? </p>
                 
                <p><strong>Androl.</strong> OH MY GOODNESS. TAIM HAS THE SEALS! HOW?! Also, heck this is crazy. Graendal is there. Androl is able to weave a small gateway and Taim's balefire goes into it. Canler and the Two Rivers boys burst into the room - here we go! </p>
                  
                <p>Toveine is Turned easily because it is easier for male channelers to turn females and vice versa. The reason the Dreadlords are having such a hard time Turning Logain is because they are all male. Toveine goes to Logain and tells him to stop resisting. She orders the others to put Logain into position so he can be Turned. Emarin has gone through two Turning sessions, and though he has not Turned, he is whimpering and crying. Logain has survived almost 12 sessions without Turning. Hessalam arrives with several Aes Sedai of the Black Ajah, including all the Reds who came to the Black Tower with Pevara.</p>
                 
                <p><strong>Perrin.</strong> DO WE TRUST LANFEAR??? Oh I want to, I really do. Perrin and Gaul in TAR at the BT. Lanfear is there. They find the dreamspike, they.. lol turn it off by twisting it. Lanfear shows Perrin how. She also says that she wants to help Rand win. </p>
                  
                <p>Lanfear admits she dosed them with forkroot and that she is helping Perrin because she is fond of him. She also tells him she is no longer one of the Forsaken because the Dark One found out she was about to help Lews Therin win and suddenly she disappears again. Perrin tells him that they will wait to see if Slayer will arrive and if not they will find him near the wolves.</p>
                 
                <p><strong>Androl.</strong> Hessalam, Taim, and a few more escape. Androl opens a gateway as wide as the floor and the remaining Dreadlords drop to their deaths. Canler and the Two Rivers boys are the ones that came in to save Androl!</p> 
                  
                <h2>Ch 15, Your Neck in a Cord, Seanchan</h2>
                <p><strong>Mat.</strong> Am I sensing some Hoid in Mat.. ah probably not. This was a hilarious exchange between Mat and Selucia. Mat climed up the side of the Tarasin Palace.. yes I said that right, he climbed up the side of the Palace. Looking for Tuon. Selucia thought he was an assassin and shot a crossbow bolt at him. Mat is going to find Tuon. </p>
                 
                <p><strong>Rand.</strong>LOVED THAT. Rand gave Tam his sword.. Laman's sword. Then Rand and Tam fought with practice swords.. SO GOOD. </p>  
                 
                <p>Tam believes it is too fine, but Rand insists on it being a thank you gift. They discuss the flame and the void. Tam reveals that it is not about archery or swords. Rather, it is about inner peace. The two go outside and Tam convinces his son to duel with him. Rand is hesitant, but eventually learns to let go and find balance.</p>
                 
                <p><strong>Mat.</strong> Whoa, how could Mat see the Gray Man?? Mat saved Tuon from a Gray Man and then Mat is shocked when she is straight taking her clothes off in front of her guards because Mat saved her lfe hahaha! I LOVE IT! She doesn't love Mat, but she married him because the omen's said so. She has to have his children. That's interesting.</p>
                 
                 <h2>Ch 16, A Silence Like Screaming, Tree</h2>
                 <p><strong>Loial.</strong> Loial always wanted to be hasty.. haha love it. Loial is also a freaking BEAST! Something is not right with the trees, it's the LB! He is singing their war song while slaying Trollocs! </p>
                 
                 <p><strong>Galad.</strong> Galad is amazed at the Ogier shredding the Trollocs.</p>  
                 
                 <p><strong>Rand.</strong> OH OH, the True Power can be used through Calandor... interesting! Rand admits that he should have trusted her. He also reveals that he is planning on ending the Dark One forever. First he must go to Ebou Dar to meet with the Seanchan and bring them to his side. Moiraine tells him that the pact is simply a piece of paper and it is distracting him from his goal.</p>
                  
                 <p><strong>Moiraine.</strong> Moiraine wishes she knew how the Wheel weaved, and that she understood it. You and me both Moiraine! </p>
                  
                 <p><strong>Lan.</strong> Taim! Lan and the Malkieri continue to fight a hard fight. </p>
                  
                 <h2>Ch 17, Older, More Weathered, Dragon</h2>
                 <p><strong>Mat.</strong> Rand shows up and makes a deal with Tuon.. Mat vouches for him and Tuon agrees to help as long as Rand helps secure their borders. Now, this singing... Rand proves her logic is wrong as he is Lews Therin Telamon reborn so his rule supersedes her own. At this, the grass begins to grow more green around Rand. Mat notices that Rand is singing very softly and as he does so the green begins to spread and sprout more trees and growth. Is this Tree Singing?? Or the Singing that LTT was talking about in the Dragonmount Prologue??? I'VE BEEN LOOKING FOR THIS FOR SO LONG!</p>
                 
                  
                 <h2>Ch 18, To Feel Wasted, Flame</h2>
                 <p><strong>Gawyn.</strong> Is it time to keep secrets Gawyn, no. Gawyn is still contemplating the black rings he stole from the SC assassins, the Bloodknives. He asks Leilwin about them as she returns with his food. She reacts with a hiss and tells them that the Empress gives them to Bloodknives. The rings are dangerous and with one touch of blood the ring will become activated which will become deadly. He pockets the rings and tells himself that the way of a Warder is to protect her on the battlefield and not to ride out like some hero. He decides not to tell Egwene about the rings.</p>
                 
                 <p><strong>Rand.</strong> Will Rand die at the end of this book? I don't know. I'm here for the ride. Rand is currently holding the Mask of Mirrors as Jur Grady, while killing Trollocs and thinking about Trollocs.  Lews Therin had known of Aginor's experiments, but was still surprised when first faced with a Trolloc. As the clouds begin to part in the sky around him, Rand realizes it's time to go. He drops the disguise and weaves Air, Fire, and Water to create a column of light stretching from him to the sky. Soldiers cheer for him. Rand now knows that the BT is free! Taim is on the loose. </p>
                 
                <p><strong>Lan.</strong> Lan wants to rebuild Malkier as he and Nynaeve as King and Queen. It is a nightly routine to salute the fallen soldiers. Lan trusts Agelmar.</p>
                 
                 <h2>Ch 19, The Choice of a Patch, Dice</h2>
                 <p><strong>Elayne.</strong> Trollocs are heading into Cairhien. Oh boy. </p>
                 
                  <p><strong>Egwene.</strong> So balefire is breaking down the Pattern.. interesting lol. Egwene is in TAR meeting with the WOs and they say they won't come back anymore. They all say they're proud of each other. IT IS BEAUTIFUL! Egwene wakes and meets with Rand. Rand says she's like a sister to him.. then he tells about Galad being his half-brother... Tigraine is mom. Then Egwene shows Rand the seals. He reveals they are FAKE! The Dark One has the keys to his own prison! OH NO! Rand remembers his handiwork in creating the seals, but these aren't it - they're copies!</p>
                 
                  <p><strong>Mat.</strong> Oh heck, Mat's dressed like a bloody noble! haha. Mat is now wearing a tailored ceremonial warriors outfit. They lacquer his fingernails.. he insists on wearing his hat lol. Mat is on his way to check on his army, because he controls the SC army now. </p>
                 
                  <h2>Ch 20, Into Thakan'dar, Aiel</h2>
                 <p><strong>Egwene.</strong> SHARAN'S! WHOA!!! We've heard barely any of them and boom, a THOUSANDFOLD OF DARKFRIENDS! Are Siuan and Bryne dead?? WE WILL FIND OUT! </p>
                 
                 <p>The Trollocs scatter as the attack turns on them, but as more coordinated groups of Trollocs linked to a Fade charge the hilltop the group retreats through a gateway. Egwene senses something is not right just before a very large gateway opens up before them. She sees an enormous army wearing strange clothes made of knee-length padded armor reinforced with chain. The army is accompanied by hundreds of women who can channel wearing stiff dresses of black silk. She tells her Aes Sedai to release the One Power so that they cannot be sensed. Romanda does not listen and begins to weave a gateway. She never gets the chance to finish as she is obliterated where she stood. The group scrambles through the camp and Lelaine says that the invaders are Sharan. Their command tent is assaulted with the One Power. Egwene and Gawyn react in time, but Egwene searches for signs of Lelaine and wonders if Siuan or Bryne were in there as well. The pair hide for over an hour. Egwene silently resolves to stay strong and survive, but also allows herself to be held by Gawyn.</p>
                  
                 <p><strong>Aviendha.</strong> Here we go, tomrrow Rand is going to invade Shayol Ghul. Nice. He WILL take Callandor, even though it might be his downfall. Rand will command the channelers in Thakan'dar. Min will keep an eye on Egwene and the SC who will fight together. These people know about the fake seals now. </p>
                 
                <h2>Ch 21, Not a Mistake to Ignore, Bull</h2>
                <p><strong>Siuan.</strong> Siuan and Bryne live! Siuan orders Haerm to search for Egwene. Bryne is having trouble since he missed the Trollocs waiting and thinks he made a mistake. </p>
                 
                <p><strong>Lyrelle.</strong> Here we go.. bonding Asha'man! 47! Let's do this! </p> 
                 
                <p><strong>Pevara.</strong> Let's go! Black Tower!!! Androl states that they will follow Logain's orders, because Logain gave them hope. They will also honor Rand's last order, to think of themselves not as weapons, but as men. Also, I have a theory of Logain that started this book - it seems to be hanging by a fingernail, but I think Logain is actually Demandred. I think! </p>
                 
                <h2>Ch 22, They Wyld, Forsnaken</h2>
                <p><strong>Egwene.</strong> And immediately, I am wrong... hahaha. The Wyld, Bao from Shara, also known as Barid Bel, also known as Demandred is here. The Sharan's are crazy and awesome, and such worldbuilding here and now?! In the LAST BOOK! GIMME GIMME! </p>
                 
                <p><strong>Perrin.</strong> So let me get this straight, was Graendal calling Davram - Moridin? Or was she just talking to herself about Moridin, then going into Davram's dream?? Also, Perrin is V good at TAR! Perrin could learn to shift between the dream world and the real world. Lanfear is excited to be at Perrin's side - he declines lol. As we've heard, time works differently in TAR and Shayol Ghul. I wonder how much time has past. </p>
                  
                <h2>Ch 23, At the Edge of Time, Pattern</h2>
                <p><strong>Gawyn. </strong> Gawyn slips on one of the rings of the Bloodknives... silly Gawyn. </p>
                 
                <p><strong>Egwene.</strong>Whoa, Egwene was almost taken again by the Sharan's, but Leilwin was there to save her! They leave, after Gawyn had killed a dozen Sharan's lol. She couldn't see Gawyn, because he's got that BK ring on! Silly Gawyn. </p>
                 
                <p><strong>Aviendha.</strong> Whoa, a lot here. Avi attacks the Shadow-forgers and releases the captives. She battles channelers who use balefire and that cracks the earth. It's Falion and Duhara that are the Dreadlords, they say. There is a third, but they don't know who. Traveling grounds are then setup. </p>
                  
                 <p><strong>Rand.</strong> SHEEEEESH. I CAN'T WAIT FOR THIS! Rand approaches the base of the mountain of Shayol Ghul. Her orders no channeling until the strike on the DO, if possible.  Nynaeve suggest that Rand should rest, eyeing the old wound in his side. His blood ran inside his boot & he left a bloody footprint behind…blood on the rocks. He unsheathes Callandor & asks Moiraine & Nynaeve to form a circle. Moiraine asks if one of them should lead so he could use that safely. Rand states that he doesn’t intend to be safe. So long as he led the circle, another could strike and seize control of him. Questioning himself about whether or not he had planned well enough and was it the right time, a voice in all capital letters booms “IT IS TIME. LET THE TASK BE UNDERTAKEN”. Rand was not surprised, as he had heard this voice once before now. He had been hoping for it.</p>
                  
                 <h2>Ch 24, To Ignore the Omens, Seanchan</h2>
                 <p><strong>Fortuona.</strong> Mat has been named Knotai, Rodholder. Meaning, if Galgan fell, he’d assume control of the armies. They receive word that Egwene’s forces are being scattered, Mat tells them to help and Tuon gives the word. They will help! </p>
                 
                <p><strong>Lan.</strong> Alright, Lan, don’t die on me. Lan and his High Guard are front and center of this next wave of Trollocs. Agelmar is having troubled dreams lately, I sure hope this isn’t another Ingtar / Darkfriend issue for Lan!!! </p>
                 
                <p><strong>Elayne.</strong> Is the sun going out because Rand entered Shayol Ghul? That’s neat. Elayne rallies the troops, they’re in Cairhien now. The battle begins. More Trollocs by the way. A LOT OF TROLLOCS THIS BOOK. Yes, it’s the Last Battle. So, I’m having fun with it. Reading on! </p>
                 
                <p><strong>Rodel.</strong> Go Rodel! She, the the Windfinders are using the Bowl of the Winds to keep the DO from killing everyone with tempests - I see the Cloud Bowl was important after all! Rodeo has incredible plans to stop the Trollocs and he does. One more day held off. They’ll be back.</p>
                 
                  
                <h2>Ch 25, Quick Fragments, Dragon</h2>
                <p><strong>Siuan.</strong> Egwene is all good. They’re at the southeaster tip of Kandor, because Bryne said it would lead to a small advantage. Min arrives and says the SC are fighting the Shadow. Egwene orders the battle lines ready, but keep an eye on the SC.</p>
                 
                <p><strong>Rand.</strong> Rand is in the caves, the DO senses him. Rand continues to say “Shai’tan”. One of Rand’s bonded are in trouble. Moirdin is there, there is a husk in the shape of a man with no eyes behind Moiridin - Shaidar Haran? Moiridin declines Rand’s invitation to the Light lol, and a duel begins! THIS IS EXCITING! </p>  
                 
                <p><strong>Lan.</strong> Hmm. Lan’s troops are ordered to fall back, then two sets of reserves come - an error??</p>
                 
                <p><strong>Perrin.</strong> Ah, see I see why people like Perrin. Buuuut, it took 13 books for that love to be there. Anyways, this is very interesting - the connection between the word of dreams and the waking world. Interesting. Perrin tracked Graendal to the Pit of Doom. Perrin sees Rand and Moiridin and Moraine and Nynaeve, and Slayer! Then Slayer and Perrin fight, then they get to the red-veiled Aiel. Perrin and Gual kill the red-veiled Aiel. Lancer tells them to kill them. Perrin thinks killing them in TAR will kill them forever. Lancer says it wdoesn’t work that way for men. </p> 
                 
                <p>Lanfear states that the teeth were filed on these two and that meant that they had been Turned. Gaul slits their throats in mercy. Perrin gets Lanfear to heal Gaul. Perrin knows that the veil between the two worlds was thin here and he sends a message to Nynaeve that if she wants to make a gateway, then she’ll have to create it in front of the cavern. He placed the dreamspike so that the bubble was large enough to fit inside the cavern and shelter Rand, the Bore and those with him. All of the borders save the one here at the front were inside rock. Slayer would have to enter through the front. Perrin sets the wolves to protect the entrance. Perrin is curious as to what Graendal was doing.</p>
                 
                <h2>Ch 26, Considerations, Flame</h2>
                <p><strong>Egwene.</strong> Oh yes, this is good. I am terrified for Egwene, does she have the upper hand here? I really don't know. But, as Egwene said, anyone who will help fight a Trolloc is a friend. </p>
                 
                <p>Egwene reminds her that Rand promised the Seanchan would help. In accordance with the Dragon's Peace, Fortuona also acknowledges the nation borders as they are currently mapped and will take no marath'damane except in the lands they control, namely Altara, Amadicia, Tarabon, and Almoth Plain. Since Tremalking is mapped as Sea Folk country, Egwene presses Fortuona to release it and the other Sea Folk isles.</p>
                 
                <p>Another argument ensues in which Egwene says the a'dam works just as well on sul'dam, because they can learn to channel and dares Fortuona to put on the collar herself, because she once trained damane as well.</p>
                 
                <p>Mat goes between them and reminds them their armies need them level-headed. Fortuona promises to help and will send some sul'dam and damane to reinforce the Aes Sedai at the ford. Before leaving, Egwene whispers to Mat that she will find a way to free him, but he says he can manage.</p>
                 
                <p><strong>Elayne.</strong> DAVRAM BASHERE IS A DARKFRIEND?! NO WAY! Obviously Graendal was communicating with Bashere, I thought she was trying to influence him in his dreams recently - my assumption is this was a recent development, not the entire time he was with Rand. But mayyyyybe, maybe it has been the entire time Bashere has been with Rand. That would be interesting on a re-read! </p>
                 
                <h2>Ch 27, Friendly Fire, Sun</h2>  
                <p><strong>Bryne.</strong> And so, Min is sent to the the Seanchan to gather some SC reinforcements. Also, Uno is in charge of the lancers! UNO!</p>
                 
                <p><strong>Min.</strong> Well dang, Min is the new Truthspeaker for Tuon.. whoa! </p>
                  
                <p>After Fortuona has entered the room, Min describes a Viewing she has of Fortuona to Mat. The other woman overhears and once she has ascertained that Min is what the Seanchan know as a Doomseer, she names Min her new Soe'feia.</p>
                  
                <h2>Ch 28, Too Many Men, Heron</h2> 
                <p><strong>Lan.</strong> I do wonder how Bashere was turned.. sorry, to the dark side. He wasn't mentioned here, but am I to assume Agelmar a darkfriend as well? It can't be - this could be an example of leaders being in office too long lol. But, Lan changes the orders as he somewhat outranks Agelmar. Baldhere thinks something is wrong with Agelmar. </p>
                 
                <p><strong>Loial.</strong> Holy smokes, I was about to be pissed. Loial CAN NOT DIE HERE! Oh, that would be so sad. </p>
                 
                <p>Loial fought alongside the other Ogier against the second Trolloc force. They sing a song of mourning. It pains him to see humans dead around him. Their bravery to fight despite their short life span gives him new determination and he sings a song of life, making the plants around them turn green again.</p>
                 
                <p><strong>Mat.</strong> Ah, Mat is his own coat and shirt.. feels good. Mat not trusting the maps, wanting a look for himself.. feels good. Tuon accompanying Mat to the battlefield, let's see how that goes.</p>
                   
                <h2>Ch 29, The Loss of a Hill, Trollocs</h2> 
                <p><strong>Egwene.</strong> Ah, the left flank! Only a few cavalrymen survive. Egwene wants to question Bryne, then she will join the fray. </p>
                 
                <p><strong>Lan.</strong> Yikes. everything is happening! Agelmar was under Compulsion. Then Tenobia dies in the battle after being surrounded. Lan stops Agelmar from killing himself. </p> 
                 
                <p><strong>Mat.</strong> So, I REALLY HOPE ALL THE GREAT CAPTAINS DON'T TURN OUT TO BE DARKFRIENDS... cough cough Rodel Ituralde. So, Gareth Bryne is a Darkfriend, is what we're saying now. So that's Bashere, Bryne, Agelmar was under Compulsion (does that count?), Pedron Niall wasn't a darkfriend, so maybe there is hope that Ituralde isn't! Whoa. </p>
                 
                <p> Also, Mat is a beast. Mat orders Tylee to tak eht right flank and Makoti the middle, Mat wants to deal the with channelers. </p>
                 
                <p>In the midst of battle, Mat takes out an Ayyad woman, which is rare for a man and a great honor as Fortuona later tells him. Having seen Mat fight, the Seanchan soldiers are in awe of him. After the skirmish, Mat rides back to Fortuona, who is displeased about his joining the battle. But he explains he had to feel "its pulse" to know it. Mat demands absolute control of the Seanchan armies and sends Min to Egwene to warn her that Bryne is a Darkfriend.</p>
                 
                <h2>Ch 30, The Way of the Predator, Wolf</h2>
                <p><strong>Perrin.</strong>  So that's it then, Graendal has the Great Captains. She's good. Elyas is in the wolf-dream as well. I really love this. I really love the wolf dream and I really love Perrin now. It took 13 books for me to love Perrin but hey, here we are.</p>
                 
                <p>An old wolf calls Perrin, though he doesn't recall its name and shows him Hessalam, coming out of Rodel's tent. She immediately opens a gateway to the real world. He says they need to send warning and the wolf replies that he could do it. Perrin realizes that the wolf is Elyas. Perrin also realizes that Hessalam is influencing the mind of each of the great captains. They see Slayer at the entrance to the Pit of Doom and go to confront him while Elyas goes to stop Rodel.</p>
                  
                <p><strong>Rand.</strong> Uh oh, Rand slipped into the darkness. Rand is fighting Moridin - using Callandor as a sword, that's AWESOME! LTT was always the better swordsman, also Rand's one lesson with Tam about fighting with one hand made him an expert at swordsmanship with one hand lol. </p>
                 
                <p>Rand asks Moridin if the Dark One punished him for thinking he was the Dark One, and he replies that he has, by returning him to life.</p>
                  
                <p><strong>Elayne.</strong> Well that was beautiful and destructive, and really awesome. What a way to introduce a character like Androl, and slowly trickle in his backstory and the power of his "small" ability with gateways to then literally use Dragonmount and DESTROY LINES AND LINES OF TROLLOCS with a gateway that was 100 FEET ACROSS. SO AWESOME! Logain is here btw, so is Androl and more Asha'man and their Aes Sedai. Taim's study had notes on this Shadow attack.</p>
                 
                <h2>Ch 31, A Tempest of Water, Trollocs</h2> 
                <p><strong>Egwene.</strong> Well, hmm. Egwene doesn't believe Mat about Bryne. I BELIEVE YOU MAT! Also, I love Uno lol. </p>
                 
                <p><strong>Rodel.</strong> Rodel, you're so strong! The dreams, GRAENDAL! Ahh. Elyas! </p>
                 
                <p>The Trollocs withdraw and an army of hundreds of Myrddraal appear. He thinks he should send the cavalry in to draw pressure from the infantry, but a voice in his head is telling him to withdraw. He refuses to say it and tries to give the command to Tihera. He knows that if he orders the retreat, the Trollocs will surround them. He begins to give the order when wolves come out of the fog. A man in furs leaps for Rodel and shoves him off the rocks, knocking him into a grateful unconsciousness.</p> 
                 
                  
                <p><strong>Egwene.</strong> So it was Compulsion on all the Great Captains then. So Bashere might not be a Darkfriend! That is my hope. He was more angry than anything. So idk.  But Bryne is relieved when he is no longer captain. He knew he was making mistakes. Mat is going to lead ALL THE ARMIES! That’s awesome. They’ll also get together with Ituralde’s crew. Even though Elays helped with that. We’ll see what happens next! </p> 
                 
                 
                <h2>Ch 32, A Yellow Flower-Spider, Dice</h2>
                <p><strong>Mat.</strong> Here we go! Min is going to get herself killed for her stubborness lol. She is giving her thoughts and Tuon is going to kill people based on her interpretations. Now, Min argues that her viewings may be used to warn of future events and people may be watched but not killed until they are caught doing something. Tuon agrees.</p>
                 
                <p>Then, a gateway opens with the Hall on the other side. Egwene confirms Bryne was under Compulsion and Saerin confirms all four Great Captains were targeted and that two thirds of the Borderlanders were lost in battle as a result. Mat wants to make a unified stand and Elayne is contacted through another gateway to approve this plan. Her battle is won, thanks to the Asha'man. The Field of Merrilor is the site agreed upon for their last stand.</p>  
                 
                <p><strong>Galad.</strong> Galad finds Trom's body on the battlefield outside Cairhien. He continues up a hill to Elayne who is telling her leaders of Mat's new plan and urging them to call the battle a victory, despite their huge losses.</p> 
                 
                <h2>Ch 33, The Prince's Tabac, HORN OF BLOODY VALERE!</h2>
                <p><strong>Perrin.</strong> Hmm, while Perrin is distracted, Slayer attacks, forcing him underwater. Perrin struggles to get free, finally freezing the water solid so he can shift to the shore. He is exhausted; he has been too long without sleep in the real world, as days have passed in the real world for the hours Perrin has experienced in Tel'aran'rhiod. Slayer brings a hillside down on him as Perrin shifts further away, injured.</p>
                 
                <p><strong>Faile.</strong> Ahh, Faile finally gets the Horn of Valere... beautiful, and it's disguised as Two River's Tabac. LOVE IT! Then BOOM, a bubble of evil and Berisha's gateway takes them to the Blight instead?! WHAT?!</p>
                 
                <p><strong>Aviendha.</strong> For a second I thought Cadsuane was going to be a darkfriend lol. Alright, we've got these Samma N'sei, male channeling Aiel Turned teeth filed. YIKES! This is going to get crazy! Cadsuane saved Avi, then Avi saves Cadsuane from, who I assume is Graendal - she uses a new Traveling where she folds... True Power?? </p>
                 
                <p>They both sense more channeling around the camp, more male channelers at the same time the Trollocs attack. Aviendha realises the Aiel men are those sent to the Blight on learning they can channel and explains this to Amys and Sorilea. Aviendha controls a circle and sets Flinn the task of watching for male channelers. Darlin and the army concentrate on the Trollocs while Aviendha and the channelers try to take out the Dreadlords. They don't need fancy tactics; they just need to hold the valley.</p>
                 
                <h2>Ch 34, Drifting, Lanfear</h2>
                <p><strong>Rand.</strong> I am fist-pumping right now. I AM SO PUMPED! Rand is literally looking at the Pattern, or at least a representation. He can see everything. Rand has never been here before, as LTT. He thinks that's a good sign. The DO wells up and brings his force against Rand. WHOA! </p>
                  
                <p><strong>Perrin.</strong> Perrin is not doing good. Somehow, whereever his is, the wolves don't know him or what Wolfbrothers are. Lanfear is disappointed in him. He shifts to Merrilor in search of Faile. He remembers he's in the dream. </p> 
                 
                <p><strong>Faile.</strong> And finally, we know, Setalle Anan was burned out in the White Tower. She can no longer channel. That's awesome, Brett and Dani have come to this conclusion books ago, but now to see it on page is nice. Did Berisha purposfully send them to the Blight, I don't know! But, they're close enough to Shayol Ghul to get there. I think they might go walking!</p>  
                 
                <p><strong>Aviendha.</strong> I'm so interested in this Traveling without a gateway I don't have time to mourn! Kiruna and Faeldrin, dead. More red-veils (I appreciate this shortening lol) attacking. Flinn has his left arm burned away. Graendal takes Sarene under Compulsion has her Warder is dead at her feet. WHOA! </p> 
                 
                <h2>Ch 35, A Practiced Grin, Blight</h2>
                <p><strong>Olver.</strong> So, who's it going to be? Who is going to turn up dead next? 15 people from this crew have died in the Blight already. Scary. </p>
                  
                 
                <p>They have abandoned the wagons and are heading to the Blasted Lands. Olver is acting brave and thinking on how he will kill the Shaido who killed his father and how he misses Noal, Mat and Talmanes. Faile, Vanin and Aravine are discussing their journey and the fact the trail they are on appears to have been used for wagons recently. Faile orders that they continue on to Thakan'dar.</p>
                 
                <p><strong>Cadsuane.</strong> Let's go! True Power was used by Graendal. Cadsuane, Avi, and Sorilea agree to contact each other if she shows again. </p> 
                 
                <p><strong>Faile.</strong> Oh no, did Vanin or Harnan replace the Horn with a replica?! We'll find out! Vanin and Harnan have the Horn but a.. grolm? starts attacking. Arrela battles the first while Mandevwin orders Verdin and Laandon to attack with spears. One beast kills Mandevwin's horse, knocking him to the ground. Aravine appears and Faile orders everyone to ride away as she can hear the cries of more of the beasts. Faile does not have time to chase Vanin or Harnan if they are to outpace the beasts into the Blasted Lands.</p> 
                 
                <h2>Ch 36, Unchangable Things, Dice</h2>
                <p><strong>Nynaeve.</strong> Oh, that's very interesting! Moiridin had taken Alanna and stabbed her... interesting! Nynaeve can't Heal her because Rand has a hold on her Power. Nynaeve cannot Heal her and she fears if Alanna dies then Rand, as her Warder, will go mad with rage. Nynaeve takes out her herbs and uses clothing to make a bandage but fears she cannot save Alanna without the Power.</p>
                  
                <p><strong>Mat.</strong> HOLY SMOKES... "IT'S HERE" "THEY'RE HERE". Mat is going to change the battle plans he says..</p>
                  
                <p>Mat asks Egwene if they have found the Horn yet, which they, of course, have not. Mat asks Egwene to make him a gateway to the top of the Dashar Knob where he surveys the terrain. Mat's memories tell him of similar battles fought.</p>
                 
                <p>Grady approaches to tell Mat he has fetched the soldiers, one hundred of the Band led by Delarn, and their five hundred recruits from a village. Mat instructs them to go up the River Mora and block it. Grady is to deal with the channelers while the others defend the river.</p>
                 
                <p>The Deathwatch Guards finally catch up with Mat as Gelen comes through a gateway. At this moment Mat feels it; the enemy have arrived.</p>
                 
                <p><strong>Perrin.</strong> Perrin figures out how to get out of the dream. He lands awake on the battlefield at the Field of Merrilor and Master Luhhan is there and carries him off..</p>
                  
                 <h2>Ch 37, The Last Battle, Aes Sedai. </h2>
                 <p><em>Okay, here we go. The Last Battle. 200+ pages. 50+ POVs.</em></p>
                 
                 <p><strong>Lan.</strong> Lan and the Borderlanders are charging Trollocs and Sharans. Logain and 40 Asha'man and Aes Sedai are there. They cross at Hawal Ford and attack the Sharans riding between bogs and Polov Heights. </p> 
                 
                 <p><strong>Elayne.</strong> Mat is a smart cookie, also Elayne and Birgitte BEASTS! Draghkars are down. Mat is hiding the plan, because the Shadow has spies that heard the last plan! Smart! </p>
                  
                 <p><strong>Uno.</strong> Well dang, Demandred is here balefiring whoever he sees lol. He's demanding Rand. Uno is awesome, please let him survive. He's also been asked to retreat, from a raken.. haha bloody Seanchan! Also, Demandred is in a FULL CIRCLE 72! </p>
                  
                 <p><strong>Logain.</strong> Oh Logain, let's go get the Seals. Also, Logain is scary lol. Logain stands by the Mora, he releases the power from what had been a thirty nine person circle and tells the Asha'man and Aes Sedai with him that they are going to try and find the Seals that Taim has stolen. He tells them to kill any male channelers they encounter and most go, leaving just Gabrelle, Karldin and Arel. </p>
                 
                 <p><strong>Gawyn.</strong> Gawyn put on the bloodknife rings.. Also, I LOVE THIS GATEWAY VIEW FROM ABOVE! </p>
                  
                 <p><strong>Tam.</strong> Ah Dannil, you were supposed to be there! You were on the cover EOTW! lol He was supposed to be the fourth ta'veren, right?? Also, TAM IS A BEAST! Dannil tells him that Mat is sending infantry banners from the Legion of the Dragon to try and ensure that Tam's men are able to hold their positions. Tam says he will make sure Arganda and Galad know to expect reinforcements.</p>
                  
                 <p><strong>Pevara.</strong> Well that is very interesting... why is Pevara is able to weave her own gateway and they pass through to safety? Pevara and Androl link and they continue to fight, Androl killing Trollocs and Myrddraal through creative use of gateways. Lightning strikes at them and Androl loses his gateway. </p>
                 
                 <p><strong>Mat.</strong> Who could the spy be in the command tent?? Mat sends Galad to hold the river, also the Ogier to the ford. He tells her that the battle is a little like cards, that you want your opponent to think they are winning and start betting too high, so that you can take advantage when the right hand comes along. He tells her that Demandred has sent a force to block the river, which will succeed before long and that they need a solid defense in place when they come over the river bed. Elayne says she will go. Mat goes back in the command tent thinking that Talmanes understood his signal and that Elayne is doing what he wanted, so now he just has to persuade Tuon.</p>
                   
                 <p><strong>Galad.</strong> Ha, Mat and his jokes about the Quaterstaff lol. Golever hands him a letter from Mat instructing him to move to Hawal Ford and to wait for more orders once he sees Elayne's banner.</p>
                  
                 <p><strong>Rand.</strong> The DO shows Rand possible futures where the Blight overran the world. Eventually Rand gathers the threads of the PATTERN ITSELF and tells the DO he will show him what is going to happen! </p>
                  
                 <p><strong>Egwene.</strong> Apparently Egwene knows the weaves to add something to the cracks in the earth from balefire. Neat! Then she realizes Gawyn is gone, and goes after him.. sort of. She arrives at the river, and speaks with Chubain who says at first he thought Mat was mad, but he is now able to see his reasoning for some of what he has done, but does not understand why Mat abandoned the Heights only to assault them again. Gawyn is up there. </p>
                  
                 <p><strong>Gawyn.</strong>So what you're telling me is: Demandred stabs Gawyn in the stomach and tells Gawyn that if he survives, he should tell Lews Therin that Demandred is looking forward to a match between the two and has improved since they last met. Demandred leaves and Gawyn pulls himself onto a horse and rides off. </p>
                  
                 <p><strong>Faile.</strong> How are Faile and crew going to get back?? They come up on the village that Isam lived in, they see a group of Samma N'Sei and they realize they can't sneak past. They plan. </p>
                  
                 <p><strong>Perrin.</strong> Awesome. Perrin knows about Faile, he believes she's not dead - the Horn HAS TO BE THERE! and then...  he falls asleep, and considers the possibilities of the Wolf Dream, the Wolf Dream in the flesh, and true sleep and realises he needs true sleep or he will die.</p>
                  
                 <p><strong>Androl.</strong> So Androl has a Talent of gateways, but it's... more than that it seems. Also, they love each other. That's great, I'm happy for them. Now,  if they are going to get the Seals from Taim, they will have to use stealth.</p>
                 
                 <p><strong>Rhuarc.</strong> Oh this might be a huge problem. Graendal has used Compulsion on Rhuarc. OH NO! </p>
                  
                 <p><strong>Rand.</strong> Rand builds a beautiful future. The DO says this is flawed and the DO attacks, the world because just a possibility. </p>
                  
                 <p><strong>Silviana.</strong> Egwene feels Gawyn hurt, almost dead. Silviana requests to take his bond to help. Egwene refuses.</p>
                  
                 <p><strong>Elayne.</strong> Birgitte doesn't remember anything besides this life. Nice note from Mat to Galad..  It has a note telling him to do what must be done along with a copy of his medallion that Elayne made. They don't understand, so Galad turns the page over, and sees further instructions that he is to go and kill as many Sharan channelers as he can. Bryne also arrives, to tell her that Gawyn had been that way and that no one knows where he is.</p>
                  
                 <p><strong>Mat.</strong> Logain wants to be the Dragon's Replacement.. I like it.. Glory to come! Then.. boom, a GRAY MAN! </p>
                  
                 <p><strong>Min.</strong> Siuan Sanche, is dead. Min is awesome with her knife throws, Mat and Tuon are safe, and Siuan is dead. Gray Men attacked. Min tells Siuan that Siuan was supposed to stay near Gareth, if she wanted to live and Siuan says she did that and they saved each other's lives. Min tells her the danger still exists. Siuan tells her it is more important to save Mat, even if it costs both their lives. I agree, but aw Siuan. </p>
                  
                 <p><strong>Egwene.</strong> Gawyn is going to get Egwene killed, I just know it! Egwene is intending to fight her way through EVERYTHING to get to Gawyn. I mean, he's not even as pretty as Galad, come on Egwene.</p>
                  
                 <p><strong>Demandred.</strong> Whoa, a lot here. But, Taim arives, through a True Power gateway. He mocks Demandred for losing the battle near the ruins and Demandred has two dozen of his Ayyad shield him but Taim seizes the True Power and fights back. Demandred shields him with a True Power shield and pulls energy out of him and the intense use of the True Power begins to unravel the Pattern. He tells Taim to keep away from him, from Lews Therin, and from the enemy general, but other than that he doesn't care what chaos he creates . He turns and weaves balefire from the True Power, destroying hundreds of the forces of the Light. He tells Taim to go and is amazed that he is able to Travel with the True Power. </p>
                  
                 <p><strong>Rand.</strong> "THE DEAD ARE MINE. I WILL SHOW YOU" The DO to Rand.. whoa! </p>
                  
                 <p><strong>Juilin.</strong> Ah Juilin.. he is leading a squad of pikes against the Sharans. </p>
                  
                 <p><strong>Pevara.</strong> Sweet, inverted Mask of Mirrors! Eventually they are found out.. and come to Demandred, who tells them that if he sees any Dreadlords away from the fight against the White Tower forces, he will make them wish he had given them to the Trollocs. Androl thinks what they did was effective, as they know where to find Taim.</p>
                  
                 <p><strong>Galad.</strong> Gawyn, dead. Not before telling Galad he's got a brother! HA! Ah no crying here. Galad is making use of Mat's foxhead medallion. Ahh, Gawyn. </p>
                  
                 <p><strong>Egwene.</strong> Let's see how Egwene deals with this.. not good. But at least she's safe. </p>
                  
                 <p><strong>Tam.</strong> Oh Tam, let's do it! Tam and crew are out of arrows. They attack with everything else! </p>
                 
                 <p><strong>Fortuona.</strong> AHHHH, smart you all. First, the Deathwatch Guards are sentenced to die in battle. Then, Min is raised to Blood. Then, Min and Tuon fake fight and pretend like they're leaving the battle to try to snuff out the spy. </p>
                 
                 <p><strong>Rand.</strong> The DO shows Rand a world in the Fourth Age, where the DO took people's consciences. Rand then grabs the Threads and says he will show him the world's oppsoite. What is going to happen with this Thread battle??</p>
                  
                 <p><strong>Mat.</strong> So Mat wants a look at what Demandred is doing huh? Let's do it! </p>
                  
                 <p><strong>Tam.</strong> What a beautiful perspective. Lan meeting Tam... AH LOVE IT! And Berelain asking for Galad... we know why you're asking Berelain! </p>
                  
                 <p><strong>Elayne.</strong> Ah, just like that BRYNE IS DEAD TOO! Whoa, Demandred is going off it seems, smart on his part. Trying to balefire Elayne lol. Birgitte instructs Celebrain to raise a banner and ride in the opposite direction as a decoy. Elayne is not happy, as this is effectively a death sentence, but Birgitte makes her realise it is necessary.</p>
                  
                 <p><strong>Galad.</strong> GO GALAD! Galad found Demandred and called him out. Now they fight! </p>
                  
                 <p><strong>Nynaeve.</strong> The Wisdom from the Two Rivers using her herbs.. GO NYNAEVE! </p>
                  
                 <p><strong>Mat.</strong> Teslyn!! LOIAL!! Now, Mat and crew are going to Travel to the Heights to move as many of the troops as possible, to move them to the top of the Heights with the intention of seizing the northern slope and preventing Demandred from fully surrounding Elayne's armies. </p>
                  
                 <p><strong>Egwene.</strong> Bringing the fury of the Amyrlin with her... DANG GO EGWENE! Egwene needs a Warder and none other than Leilwin Shipless is there! Egeanin! </p>
                  
                 <p><strong>Galad.</strong> Holy crap. Galad's arm has been removed at the elbow from Demandred. Then, all goes black at another swing from Demandred. lol. Damodred and Demandred dueling. </p>
                  
                 <p><strong>Androl.</strong> HAHA, Taim places a Mask of Mirrors on Androl to look like Androl as Androl is using the Mask of Mirrors to look like Nensen. In that, Androl stole the Seals from Taim's pouch! </p>
                  
                 <p><strong>Arganda.</strong> Galad dead? I'll hold off. Arganada is a good guy. Lan and his army is there, then Loial and the Band is there. Let's do this. Mat is awesome. </p>
                  
                 <p><em>First days read of The Last Battle 41 perspectices in 147 pages. 69 pages to go just in ch 37. 183 pages to go in the book. Death Count: Siuan, Gawyn, Bryne.</em></p>
                 
                 <p><strong>Rand.</strong> This is very interesting. In removing the DO from the Pattern, the DO will still win?? Rand sees Elayne, in this created world that he manifested and as she babbles on, Rand looks into her eyes and sees a shadow, similar to that in the eyes of someone who has been turned. He realizes that the Dark One is not merely the source of evil, he is the manifestation of evil and that by removing him from existence, he has taken away the ability to do or be evil, condemning people to be insipid and vacuous. He realises the world he would create is horrible.</p>
                  
                 <p><strong>Mat.</strong> Truly, this is an incredibly well written battle. This is so awesome! Something is attacking the Sharans, they are fleeing across the Heights. </p>
                  
                 <p><strong>Olver.</strong> First off, Faile acting humbly like a servant - her time as gaishain.. nice. Second off, Aravine darkfriend, I love it. I love this. All these darkfriends coming into the open at the Last Battle. This is so awesome, I mean not for us, but wow. So unexpected. I LOVE IT! Also, GO OLVER! SAVE THEM ALL! </p>
                  
                 <p><strong>Leane.</strong> AHH DOESINE! Also FREAKING GO OFF EGWENE. DANG! MORE POWER THAN LEANE HAS EVER SEEN A WOMAN HOLD! GO GO GO!</p>
                  
                 <p><strong>Talmanes.</strong> We'll dance the Jak O'the Shadows! Keep the spirits up Talmanes! Hey, I'm a fan of your humor.. who cares what they think! Interesting... there is an Asha'man that knows of a cavern with no exits.. hmm. Darkfriend in the midst perhaps?? </p>
                  
                 <p><strong>Faile.</strong> Oh man, Bela, you're doing great! Faile kills Aravine, after figuring out Harnan and Vanin were really just looking for Mat's tabac lololololol. Faile gives the Horn to Olver. Faile is going to distract the Trollocs and Fades. This might be the end of Faile. </p>
                  
                 <p><strong>Logain.</strong> Uh Logain.. sir, please be a good guy. You're sounding a bit like a bad guy right now... please be good! Androl is raised to full Asha'man.. love it! Pevara tells him he should take the Seals to the Aes Sedai as they belong to the White Tower, but he replies that the Amyrlin is as good as dead and he is a fitting steward. He tells them he is going to find Demandred and the others are to deal with Taim's men and the Sharan channelers, apart from Gabrelle who is to wait for him. He thinks that if he can get Demandred's sa'angreal, the world would tremble for him and the Black Tower.</p>
                  
                 <p><strong>Egwene.</strong> OH SHOOOOT! TAIM! EGWENE V TAIM... OH SHOOOOOOT! Also, thank you Narishma, I've always been a huge fan of you. </p>
                  
                 <p><strong>Ila.</strong> TINKERS! Ah, Ila and Raen, it's been a while. And Raen might pick up a weapon to help, I think that is valient! </p>
                  
                 <p><strong>Olver.</strong> OH NO BELLLLLLA! We've lost Bela y'all. Olver hides in a rocky outcrop. "Have to get the Horn to Matrim Cauthon."</p>
                  
                 <p><strong>Logain.</strong> Whoa, I did in fact think Logain was going to do some damage to Damandred. It didn't. Also, no real mention of Galad anymore, so I will put him on the death count.. pour one out. Also, this feels like war. This is CRAZY!</p>
                  
                 <p><strong>Egwene.</strong> Ah, almost Egwene! Egwene nearly gets a shield on Taim, but he uses the True Power to Travel away. She then launches herself at the Sharans. So this balefire is not doing great for the Pattern lol. Literally ripping holes in the earth.</p>
                  
                 <p><strong>Hurin.</strong> THE SNIFFER! Ah, I've missed you Hurin. Anyways, Hurin is awesome and the Trollocs are preparing their final attack Lan says. Hurin also plugged his nose, too stinky lol.</p>
                 
                 <p><strong>Berelain.</strong> Uh oh, who is going to get the foxhead medallion now?? Galad is alive, for now, I'll take him off my death count lol. That's only 5 so far. Also, Annoura burned out. dang. </p>
                  
                 <p><strong>Rand.</strong> So this bit was real, dang. Davram Bashere, not a Darkfriend dead. His wife, dead. HURIN DEAD! OH HURIN! Jori Conger dead TWO RIVERS! Enaila, Manfor, Beldine, dead. One more thing the DO says. </p>
                  
                 <p><strong>Taim.</strong> Well dang, the Sakarnen, I wonder if what Damandred said is true - that he's bonded it. M'Hael.. I want to know how he never went mad! Rand would've seen the tendrils to the DO. But Taim now has the sa'angreal that Damandred had and is on a mission to burn Egwene out of the Pattern. OH NO. </p>
                  
                 <p><strong>Elayne.</strong> First off, HOLY FREAKING CRAP! MELLAR BEHEADED BIRGITTE YIIIIIIKES! Also, Moonshadow dead. OH MY GOSH! Someone with Mellar is going to cut Elayne's babies out... oh no. She's only 6 months along. The DO wants Elayne's babies. OH MY GOSH. His companion knows the weave to keep the babies alive, from a Forsaken. OH MY GOSH! </p>
                  
                 <p><strong>Rand.</strong> Ah, "I will give you the Void you always seek".. that's deep. Rand continues his battle! </p>
                  
                 <p><strong>Min.</strong> YEP, Min's awesome. She's with Tuon and SC. Yulan is under Compulsion. There is a freckled spy so'jhin. Min throws a knife at her and it is held in air. The woman flees through a gateway. Tuon tells Galgan to gather his troops as they are returning to Merrilor. </p>
                  
                 <p><strong>Egwene.</strong> HO-LY SMOKES! That was SO FREAKING INCREDIBLE. IT WAS HORRIBLE AND AWFUL AND GUTWRENCHING AND AHHHHHHHH. EGWENE!!! First she freaking bests Taim with what she calls the Flame of Tar Valon - the opposite of balefire. And then She realises that if she releases the Power she will be burned out. She tells Leilwin to break the Seals at the moment the Light shines, releases the bond and pushes her through a gateway. Surrounded by hundreds of Sharan channelers, she draws in more power and releases her new weave, killing them and sealing the cracks Taim created. OH MY GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOSH EGWENE! NOOOOO! </p>
                  
                 <p><strong>Rand.</strong> Rand feels for Egwene. He HURTS now that she is dead. OH MY GOODNESS! EGWENE. NO! </p>
                  
                 <p><strong>Leane.</strong> THE AMYRLIN HAS FALLEN. Leane sees Sharans crystalise. At the top of a fifty foot high column of crystal, she sees Vora's sa'angreal and realises the Amyrlin has fallen. OH MY GOSH. OH MY GOSH.</p>
                  
                 <p><strong>Berelain.</strong> Galad tells Berelain to take the foxhead medallion to Mat.</p>
                   
                 <p><strong>Mat.</strong> My goodness Mat is sad for Egwene. ME TOO MAT. ME TOOOOO. Also Egwene took out ALL THE SHARAN CHANNELERS?!?! WOW WOW WOW! Our Aes Sedai are too tired. Elayne is not dead. LAN IS GOING TO GO AFTER DEMANDRED ALONE?! HOW FREAKING EPIC. LAN PLEASE DON'T DIE. </p>
                  
                 <p><strong>Olver.</strong> Is Olver going to make it to Mat in time?!</p>
                  
                 <p><strong>Loial.</strong> OH man I love Loial. Loial is going to witness the fall of the last king of Malkier.. no he won't LAN WILL SURVIVE.</p>
                  
                 <p><strong>Arganda.</strong> Arganda lines up his men for a charge that Tam expects to fail. Tam sees Lan riding to Demandred, his way blocked by Trollocs and orders his men to fire on them. He looses a burning arrow.</p>
                  
                 <p><strong>Lan.</strong> Lan is it y'all! "I am the man who will kill you" Lan says to Demandred. Also, freaking yes Tam and the Two Rivers men. YES GO LAN! </p>
                  
                 <p><strong>Min.</strong> Min is back at Merrilor lol, riding a torm!</p>
                  
                 <p><strong>Rand.</strong> Oh Rand hears a voice "let it go" WHO?! Rand thinks he failed.</p>
                 
                <p><strong>Lan. </strong> Finally, Demandred tells Lan that he has him and that he can't win. Thinking of the time he taught Rand Sheathing the Sword, Lan replies that Demandred didn't listen; that he wasn't there to win, but to kill him. And he does.</p>
                 
                 <p><em>Death Count: Siuan, Gawyn, Bryne, Doesine, Bella, Davram, Deira, Hurin, Jori Conger, Enaila, Manfor, Beldine, Egwene, Lan</em></p>
                 
                 <h2>Ch 38, The Place That Was Not, Ravens</h2>
                 <p><strong>Rand.</strong> OH THIS IS AWESOME. Rand thinking about all the sacrifices his friends have made for him. AHHH SO GOOOOD. He lets go of the guilt at not protecting them and the need to do so. He lets go of the list he had carried, that had once been the women who had died for him, but which had grown into all people who had. Ilyena was the last, and he feels as though a giant weight has been lifted from his shoulders. He stands up once more to face the Shadow. Also, that voice was Tam's lol. </p>
                 
                 <p><strong>Shendla.</strong> Bao the Wyld is dead. What now?! The battlefield grows still. </p>
                  
                 <p><strong>Rand.</strong> Rand seeks the Void and tells the DO that he doesn't control the world. </p>
                  
                 <p><strong>Loial.</strong> Oh man, I'm going to need some more tissues, "Tai'shar Malkier!" ahhhhhh.</p>
                  
                 <h2>Ch 39, Those Who Fight, The Horn</h2>
                  <p><strong>Rand.</strong> Rand hears the Dark One say he will take the Son of Battles as he took the King of Nothing. Rand tells the Dark One that he was not watching closely enough and he was very wrong about one thing.</p>
                  
                 <p><strong>Olver.</strong> Olver blows the Horn. OLVER BLOWS THE HORN OF VALERE!!!</p>
                  
                 <p><strong>Mat.</strong> Mat hears Rand in his head, telling Shai'tan he is wrong, that the one whom he has tried to kill, from whom he took everything, still fights. Lan stands up holding Demandred's head. The battlefield goes still and over the silence, the Horn of Valere is heard. Wait, so Lan isn't dead? </p>
                  
                 <p><strong>Elayne.</strong> BIRGITTE SILVERBOW! Getting her revenge on Mellar. THe Heroes of the Horn have returned!</p>
                  
                 <p><strong>Mat.</strong> Mat fights through the Shadow's forces to Lan, grabbing him as he falls over. Narishma joins him and briefly Heals him, bringing him back to consciousness. Mat wonders which side blew the Horn and sees the Heroes. Artur Hawkwing steps to the front as Mat sees one of them ride off. Hawkwing tells Mat that they need the banner, but that they would not fight for the Shadow. Mat suggests that he can pull his men back and allow the heroes to fight, which amuses Hawkwing, as there are far too many, even for the Heroes of the Horn.</p>
                 
                 <p><strong>Olver.</strong> NOAL!! He IS A HERO OF THE HORN?!?!?!?! Noal tells him that he did indeed die, but that the Pattern was not finished with him and tells Olver to sound the horn. Olver feels a great warmth, for one of the people he lost has come back to him.</p>
                 
                 <h2>Ch 40, Wolfbrother, Aiel</h2>
                 <p><strong>Elayne.</strong> Ah, we didn't have to mourn Birgitte for long! Her guard breaks through and between them and Birgitte, the rest of the Darkfriend mercenaries are defeated. Birgitte tells Elayne she is off to join the other heroes and Elayne should stay where she is. Elayne responds that her men believe her to be dead, and she needs to be seen to give them heart.</p>
                 
                <p><strong>Aviendha.</strong> Well dang, Darkhounds are coming. Greandal tries to shield Avi, but then Cadsuane and Amys arrive!</p>
                 
                <p><strong>Elayne.</strong> Woo! Elayne killing a Trolloc with a sword, then channeling a White Lion of Andor in the sky!</p>
                 
                <p><strong>Mat.</strong> What could that one more piece of business that needs to fall into place?? Also, Talmanes and Aludra got the dragons mended! </p>
                  
                <p><strong>Grady.</strong> So the Hinderstap village was important! Using them for the Last Battle! Nice! They pass through and fall upon the three Dreadlords keeping watch, killing them and allowing Grady to destroy the dam and release the river.</p>
                  
                <h2>Ch 41, A Smile, Forsnaken</h2>
                <p><strong>Pevara.</strong> Logain.. hmm.. Canler says he is too tired to be of much use and even Androl is struggling to open a small gateway. Pevara has an idea of how to do what they wish and Androl calls her a genius. She says Taim's men are probably trying to destroy the dragons and they are going to give them a surprise.</p>
                
                <p><strong>Mogi.</strong> Well interesting. Moghedien stands over Demandred's corpse and reaches for saidar, finding instead the True Power. She weaves the Mask of Mirrors to make herself look like Demandred and Travels to the back lines of the Sharans, where they are preparing to flee. She is accepted and tells them to gather Trollocs and send them to the ruins to attack the Caemlyn refugees. She asks why the Ayyad haven't removed the dragons and is told there are only a dozen left. The dragons go silent and she thinks Taim's men might have silenced them. A gateway opens and she looks into a dark cavern, with dragons pointing out and hears the cry "fire".</p>
                  
                <p><strong>Talmanes.</strong> Talmanes asks Neald to close the gateway and open another. The new one opens on Trollocs engaging against Whitecloaks. They fire and close the gateway. They reload and open another.</p>
                  
                <h2>Ch 42, Impossibilites, The Pattern</h2>
                <p><strong>Aviendha.</strong> Aww Aviendha. I'm so sorry! Aviendha killed Rhuarc.. awwww. She sees plants begin to grow in the once barren ground and in the skies, the clouds form the ancient symbol of the Aes Sedai. She realises it is Rand, combating the Dark One. </p>
                 
                <p><strong>Mishraile.</strong> OH YES ANDROL! Took them to a stedding. Freaking yass. lol. Let's goooo! </p>
                 
                <p><strong>Androl.</strong> Oh my gosh! Trollocs attacking the Caemlyn refugees?! Also, love Ogier. </p>
                 
                <p><strong>Aviendha.</strong> OH MY GOSH! Aviendha's legs are torn apart, broken bones and flayed skin. THEN as Graendal is about to Travel with the TP, Avi stabs her with her spear and is taken with Graendal. WHOA!</p>
                 
                <h2>Ch 43, A Field of Glass, Horn</h2>
                <p><strong>Logain.</strong> Ah, so Logain is supposed to deliver the Seals! Logain.. you're acting suspicious! Uh oh. Androl comes up to stop Logain from getting the sa'angreal, asking for help. Will Logain help? AHHHH! </p>
                 
                <p><strong>Mat.</strong> A good question, how does one become a Hero of the Horn? Also, love when Mat asks Hawkwing to talk to Tuon.. LOVE IT! Also YES SEANCHAN USE YOUR CREATURES TO TAKE OUT THE TROLLOCS. GO GO GO! </p>
                  
                <p>Mat rides with the Heroes of the Horn. He asks if he is one of them, and Hend tells him he is not, though he has done more than enough to earn a place. He sees the Seanchan army about to join with Elayne's army and sees the river return, splitting the Shadow forces. The remaining Sharans flee through gateways. Elayne's forces and the Seanchan attack the Trollocs on their side of the river, routing them. On the other side of the river, the rest of the Seanchan attack the rest of the Trollocs, using the exotic animals. The trollocs flee, but are picked off by the dragons, with the few survivors sinking into the bogs. He realises he has to go to Rand, but before he goes, asks Hawkwing to speak to Tuon.</p>
                 
                <p><strong>Rand.</strong> GO RAND. GO RAND. TEACH THE DARK ONE.</p>
                  
                <p><strong>Aviendha.</strong> Aviendha YOU CAN DO IT! Aviendha tries to weave a gateway to escape Hessalam, who sees her and prepares a shield. Aviendha ties off the gateway, leaving it open in case Amys sees it. </p>
                      
                <h2>Ch 44, Two Craftsmen, Harp</h2>
                <p><strong>Perrin.</strong> I LOVE PERRIN IN THE WOLF DREAM. I LOVE PERRIN. I just wish we got more of this Perrin in books 5-12. I needed this Perrin. Perrin is freaking awesome. He places Mah'alleinir in straps on his belt and tells Chiad he will bring Gaul if he is wounded. He closes his eyes and imagines himself close to sleep, where there is a pathway and takes the branch toward the wolf dream in the flesh and feels himself shift between worlds. He begins to hunt.</p>
                 
                <p><strong>Thom.</strong> Oh Thom, you Gleeman! Love it. Thom thinking of words to use for his ballad of the Last Battle. Thom has killed another person using the Mask of Mirrors to pretend to be someone else. Thom is awesome.</p> 
                 
                <h2>Ch 45, Tendrils of Mist, Dagger</h2>
                <p><strong>Mat.</strong> Alright, here we go. Mat and crew will be going to gateway a days hike away from Shayol Ghul. Mat also thinks about Noal being a Hero. Ahh Jain Farstrider.    </p>
                 
                <p><strong>Fain.</strong> What in the heck lol. Fain is calling himself Shaisam, his mind in all the tendrils of mist. He has consumed the souls of many Trollocs, and is controlling their bodies. He plans to find a place where the barriers between worlds are thin and seep his self into the stones, but until he can do that, he is bound to Fain's mortal body. He thinks how he had tried to create the mist before, but hadn't been mature enough. He thinks how the mist is both him and not him and that he plans to feast on the soul of Rand al'Thor. So, this isn’t The Black Wind of course, that is something different. But that also had an affect on Fain too? </p>
                  
                 <p><strong>Gaul.</strong> Oh that’s very interesting. First Slayer gets Gaul with one of Gaul’s spears. Then Perrin shows up and tells Slayer he isn’t king here. It’s for the wolves. But, Slayer tells Perrin that he wanted to channel and that Luc wanted to be part of something important, and that a prophecy had said Luc will be important to the Last Battle. He says they will kill Perrin, then Rand. Perrin opens his eyes, which glow. Gaul flees.  </p>
                  
                 <p><strong>Mat.</strong> Well heck, this is freaking awesome. EVERYTHING IS AWESOME. So, Mat says Mashadar.. soooo, this is the Black Wind that Fain is “controlling”. Which is why Fain was fine through the Ways and why it would follow Rand all that time. WOW, WORLD BUILDING! Okay, I love Mat and Olver on the to’raken.. just comedy at its finest. Over blows the Horn of Valere again, not after saying “we’re already under his banner”.. the Aes Sedai symbol literally made by the clouds above Shayol Ghul. FREAKING AWESOME!</p>
                  
                 <h2>Ch 46, To Awaken, Dragon</h2>
                 <p><strong>Rand.</strong> Oh shoot! “I don’t matter??” Throws a knife at Alanna. DANG IT MORIDIN! </p>
                 
                <p><strong>Nynaeve.</strong> Whoa now, what?! I noticed when we first met Moridin in, what we now know as, his dreamshard - he flexed his left hand, the same hand Rand had lost. I presumed some connection between the two of them. No idea how, still don’t. But, Alanna released her bond with Rand before she died - helpful! Then Moridin stabs his own hand and Rand twitches and drops Callandor. OH SHOOT THE BALEFIRE CROSSING!! IT’S COMING BACK. THEY ARE CONNECTED SOMEHOW. THE PATTERN?! HOW COULD YOU DO THIS?! </p>
                 
                <p><strong>Perrin.</strong> Oh yeah, GO PERRIN. SLAYER IS DEAD! OH and a Flicker Flicker. I LIKE THAT! MORE MORE MORE. Now, Perrin shifts Aiel to a spot to protect Rand. Then the Horn sounds and then.. WOLVES COMES. The Wild Hunt is on with the Darkhounds and now the Horn is sounded, it’s the LAST HUNT. LET’S FREAKING GO! </p>
                 
                <p><strong>Mat.</strong> Well what the heck does that mean now y’all?! Mashadar rises and spears Mat through the chest and knocks him off his horse! Also Mat and Perrin reunite as Perrin is killing a Darkhound. Freaking go off Perrin. And shoot, I forgot about Faile. </p>
                 
                <h2>Ch 47, Watching the Flow Writhe, Forsnaken</h2>
                <p><strong>Aviendha.</strong> Oh SHOOT. Aviendha was trying to unravel the gateway while Graendal was going to weave Compulsion on her. Avi picks the wrong thread and the gateway explodes lol. </p>
                 
                <p><strong>Fain.</strong> HOLY CRAP!!! Mat killed Fain!!! OH MY GOSH! Because Mat held the dagger, and whooooaaa. That’s awesome! Fain comes across what he believes to be a familiar corpse, killed by the mists, but it reaches up and grabs him by the throat. Mat tells him he once heard that if you catch a disease and survive, you can't get it again. He drops the dagger and Mat grabs it, ramming it through his ribs. Fain dies, his corpse melting away.</p>
                  
                <p><strong>Perrin.</strong> Perrin, she’s going to be safe. I feel it buddy! Man I’m such a Perrin stan now.. wow lol. Also, I love this Gaul and Perrin relationship, heck. What dude bros. Such a beautiful story they’ve had together. </p>
                  
                <p><strong>Rand.</strong> GOOD LORD THAT WAS INCREDIBLE. Let’s see if I get this straight. Rand needed ALL THREE forms of Power to destroy the DO. THAT IS INCREDIBLE. Go Rand, and go Min. And freaking, go the Light side. Heck. I think we just did it! </p>
                 
                <p>Nynaeve and Moiraine exploit the flaw in Callandor in the way that Min had worked out and take control of Moridin, before linking with Rand. With saidin, saidar and the True Power, Rand seizes the Dark One through the Bore, using the protection of the True Power to prevent saidin from being tainted again. The Dark One tries to turn off access to the True Power but there is too much of it and he is unable. Light explodes from Rand. </p>
                 
                <h2>Ch 48, A Brilliant Lance, Aes Sedai</h2>
                <p><strong>Elayne.</strong> Elayne feels Rand’s strength, control, and determination, the end has come. </p>
                
                <p><strong>Thom.</strong> Thom sees the light.</p>
                 
                <p><strong>Min.</strong> Min feels Rand and sees the light.</p> 
                 
                <p><strong>Aviendha.</strong> AHHA Graendal is Compulsed to Avi now lol.</p>
                 
                <p><strong>Logain.</strong> Do it “Sealbreaker”. OOOOOOO THAT IS FREAKING OOOOO SO GOOOOOOD. Logain breaks the Seals as he feels the light from Shayol Ghul. </p>
                 
                <h2>Ch 49, Light and Shadow, Wheel</h2>
                <p><strong>Perrin.</strong> I’m sorry… WHAT?! Lanfear had Compulsion on Perrin.. too bad lol. Perrin snapped Lanfear’s neck. LANFEAR DEAD?! Wow, that’s hard to believe. Also, the world is doing changing it seems. Dragonmount is closer than it should be. </p>
                 
                <p><strong>Rand.</strong> AHHHH, I see. Rand pulls the Dark One into the Pattern and begins to kill him. He realises that the vision of the future in which the Dark One had been killed was true, and that he must allow the Dark One to exist. He draws saidin, saidar and the True Power and weaves them together, in their pure forms, not as the individual five powers and reforges the prison. I SEE.</p>
                  
                <p><strong>Moiraine.</strong> Honey I shrunk the Dark One! Lol just kidding. WHAT THE HECK?! Lol. Moiriane pulls Nynaeve out of the Pit of Doom, unable to see because of the blinding light. She sees the blackness in front of Rand shrink away until it vanishes.</p>
                 
                <h2>Epilogue, To See the Answer, Wheel</h2>
                <p><strong>Rand.</strong> WHAT?! Who is this woman?! Is this dang Naomi?! Rand is obviously carrying Moridin’s body. How long has it been inside the tunnel?? </p>
                 
                <p><strong>Mat.</strong> Yeah Mat, you don’t need that dagger, you’ve got your hat! And the ashandari. </p>
                 
                <p><strong>Perrin.</strong> So Rand is dead? Perrin walks into the camp at the base of Shayol Ghul. He hears Damer Flinn complaining that he cannot save Rand, and that Nynaeve also tried, with Moiraine's angreal. Perrin sees Moridin and is told that he is also dying. He leaves the tent and sees Lan, who tells him that Olver was the last to see Faile. He goes to find a gateway to the Field of Merrilor. Also, yes, why would Rand bring Moridin out? </p> 
                 
                 <p><strong>Loial.</strong> Wait, Moridin is getting better… what? Also, love this perspective. Loial walking around looking to finish his book. Also also, is the Forth Age now?! Can it start in the middle of the day? That would be terrible for Calendars lololol</p> 
                 
                <p><strong>Mat.</strong> Aw, Tuon is pregnant! Mat isn’t worried about her possibly trying to kill him lol. Care for dice??</p>
                  
                <p><strong>Perrin.</strong> She can’t be dead. She just can’t! </p>
                  
                <p><strong>Mogi.</strong> That is a satisfactory ending for Mogi! Collared by a sul’dam named Shanan.</p>
                  
                <p><strong>Nynaeve.</strong> What is going on?! Avi says “let’s prepare the funeral pyre” for Rand. Rand dies, but Aviendha, Elayne and Min do not seem to care. Nynaeve thinks they must know something and she will have it out of them. She hears Aviendha telling Bair that Rhuarc's death means that something about her vision of the future has already changed. Nynaeve challenges her with Rand's death and Aviendha responds that Rand woke from the dream in greatness and it must be celebrated in greatness. Nynaeve doesn't believe a word of it and demands the truth. Aviendha merely says they must prepare his funeral pyre.</p>
                 
                <p><strong>Perrin.</strong> YES YES YES. FAILE LIVES! Perrin went to the wolf dream and went everywhere then found her scent, under Trollocs, and a horse. She was there. He went to Nynaeve for Healing and she lived! 
                </p> 
                  
                <p><strong>Birgitte.</strong> That is SATISFACTORY! Birgitte asks Elayne if she knows something about the Dragon, but Elayne shrugs. She tells Elayne that she knows Elayne wants to keep the Horn so she sent it away with Olver to dispose of it where it won't be found. She is surprised when Elayne thanks her for saving her the decision. She feels herself being reborn and tells Elayne she will be with Gaidal.</p>
                  
                <p><strong>Tam.</strong> OH COME ON! Tam lights Rand’s funeral pyre and thinks he did well. AHH GET ME SOME FREAKING TISSUES! </p>
                  
                <p><strong>Min.</strong> What does that mean? What does that mean? In the back of her mind, she feels the bond grow stronger and tells the others they must make sure everyone believes Rand gone.</p>
                  
                <p><strong>Rand.</strong> I’M SORRY, WHAT?! RAND WAKES IN MORIDIN’S BODY?! And Alivia “helped him die” and Cadsuane knows it him. HMMMMMM.</p>
                  
                 <p><strong>Cadsuane.</strong> Hey, I like Cadsuane for Amyrlin! </p>
                  
                 <p><strong>Rand.</strong> Okay, so he thought his pipe as being lit and it was. Well I’ll be. That is.. odd lol. SO! Rand walks off, relieved that Cadsuane didn't raise an alarm. He realises she probably suspects something. He pulls out a pipe and finds there is no saidin for him to use. He tries to use the True Power, just to be sure and can't use that either. He is relieved. He has no way to light his tabac, so thinks of the pipe as being lit, and it is. He looks back at Aviendha, Elayne and Min and wonders which will follow him and who he will pick. He realises he can't choose. He thinks on how it will be novel to travel just for the pleasure of seeing the world.</p>
