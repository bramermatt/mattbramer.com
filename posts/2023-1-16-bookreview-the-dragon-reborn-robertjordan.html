    <blockquote>The Dragon Reborn by Robert Jordan (Book Three in the Wheel of Time) - Book Review on YouTube</blockquote>


    <h2 id="written">Written Review</h2>
    <p>Before I start... THIS COVER.. GOLLY IS GOOD LOOKING. The more I look at it.. wow, it is my favorite cover by far. WOO!</p>

    <p>Okay, Let's talk about The Dragon Reborn. First off, this a great book, 5/5. Again another incredible book with a superb story by Robert Jordan in the Wheel of Time. Robert Jordan just knows how to write. He knows how to build a world and paint a picture of exactly what is happening and how everything and everyone looks. I'm constantly impressed by the design of the world and the characters and the settings of literally everywhere. This book takes some time to start up, because we have a bit of a recap at the beginning and we have to get caught up on where all the characters are - but you'll enjoy it for sure.</p>

    <details id="spoilers">
    <summary>Spoilers..</summary>
    <p>Time to spoil, I have some new favorite characters now..</p>

    <h2>Mat and Perrin</h2>
    <p>These boys have become more favorites of mine... their story has come to this point - now we have learned a lot more about their powers and we are just getting a little bit of Mat's power, but the more I read Mat's perspective.. and yes - we get some Mat perspectives, I love it so much! Mat is funny and quippy and that's amazing. He's also really good with his Quarterstaff and I like that - he is becoming a great character for me.</p>

    <p>Perrin is an amazing person. A great character to read and feel for. He is kind and sweet and smart and slowly becoming my favorite character. The way he cares for people is second to none, he looks out for all. He is quiet and is just great - I love it!</p>

    <h2>The Hunters Three</h2>
    <p>These girls.. Elayne, Egwene, and Nynaeve have got it going on! They are leveling up like no other - and I'll talk about that some more when I get to it, but wow. The way they are so absolutely incredibly powerful is just a testament to their characters - such great parts of the story and quite possibly some of the most important. I love them! So funny as well, when it's important.</p>

    <h2>Loial</h2>
    <p>I can't say enough, he's just great. Also so kind and caring and good when it counts.I love that we got to see more of him interacting with the Ogier - so good to read.</p>

    <h2>Rand</h2>
    <p>Literally... The Dragon Reborn, "I am Rand al'Thor.. I am the Dragon Reborn." ABSOLUTELY AMAZING STUFF. We didn't see much of Rand this book, and that was a bit disappointing, but what we got of Rand was powerful. I loved reading his scenes, even those scenes where he absolutely murdered a dog and a group of people - because he is GOING MAD. I hope! And finally we got Callandor and it is even better than I expected. I couldn't believe it could've been cooler than I thought, but the power is immense and I love reading about it. I love it.</p>

    </details>

    <h2 id="review-score">Review Score</h2>
    <p>Without a doubt 5/5.</p>

    <h2 id="read-next">What's Next to Read</h2>
    <p>As you might've read.. in (<a href="../blogs/books/2023-tbr.html">My TBR for 2023</a>), I cannot buy anymore books until I read all the books on my shelf.. so I'm thinking I might jump to The Hunger Games. That sounds like fun, I started it early in 2022, but I was reading multiple books at the time and have since been only reading one book at a time.. here's to turning another page! <em>Oooo, I like that as a catch phrase ha</em></p>
