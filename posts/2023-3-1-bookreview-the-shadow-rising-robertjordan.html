    <h2 id="written">Written Review</h2>
    <p>I am currently reading, as of February 13, 2023, and I'm no where near being done - so this is going to be a review in progress! And below, I'm going to have notes as I read, by chapter. More than likely spoilers, so I'm going to keep those hidden by the box below. When I've finished my read, the Notes box will be moved below the spoiler box, probably past the score!</p>

    <p>OKAY WOW. This is my favorite Wheel of Time book I've ever read. This is almost non-stop amazing, every single chapter. The video review I filmed first was 21 minutes long, and it could've been hours. I'm amazed by this book and amazed at the Wheel of Time and how Robert Jordan writes. This is incredible.</p>




    <h2>Spoilers</h2>
    <p>Just a bit of preamble here.. the way this review will be is a lot of different from others. I'm wrote notes on every single chapter that I read. Which is completely spoiler, so this is where the spoilers start.. read at your own risk!</p>

    <details>
        <summary>Review Scores</summary>
    <p>I'm trying a new way of reviewing, by implementing a new way to review - using a format taken from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@2ToRamble" target="_blank">2toRamble</a>! <em>And that’s the system! Rate those 5 categories out of 10, average your score, and that’s your /10 Rambler Rating! You can rate each category to the nearest hundredth, tenth, whole number, or whatever you please.</em></p>
        
    <p>This comes out to a total score of 5! An incredible book!</p>

        <h2>Chapter 1 - Seeds of Shadow</h2>
        <p>Min's back! And she's made it to White Tower (finally - we were waiting all of The Dragon Reborn (3) to find out where Min was). I've only read 14 pages right now, this first chapter is 40 pages long.. Okay, I've read some more now, Min got to talk to Siuan, and it seems Min is going to stay in the White Tower.</p>
        
        <p>Now we're follow Elaida and apparenlty she can Foretell. I'm trying to remember, but isn't it important that Moiraine's last name is Damodred? Doesn't that have something to do with Andor - and the recent Kings? Ahh, Elaida is talking to Alvarin (white) now.. obviously not hiding any thoughts about Rand..</p>
        
        <p>Now we’re following Bornhald and Ordieth is FAIN! And terrifying. And they’re so close to the Two Rivers.. at Terran Ferry (I’m happy to be back, but wish it were under better circumstances).</p>
        
        <p>Now we’re following Suroth, of the SEANCHAN and Book Two - so it’s been some time. And she is just fun to read. So “powerful”, right? I think. I’m not sure, maybe it’s just because for so long she’s been in a station of power that she thinks she can be over the sul’dom and d’amane. Scary stuff.</p>        
        
        <p>Finally done with chapter one and I can’t wait to read more!</p>
        
        <h2>Chapter 2 - Whirlpools in the Pattern</h2>
        <p>Perrin and Faile, okay I love to see this. Their relationship has gotten a lot closer since TDR. Also, this axe? What happened there - I’m sure we’ll find out. Also just thinking back on Min’s visions of the Aes Sedai and the killing, when will we see that? I have no idea when that would happen or how that would even happen and by who?! I love the Perrin and Faile relationship.</p>
        
        <p>Mat, ah Mat. I just love reading Mat chapters now. Mat is gambling with the Aiel and it’s fun to read for sure. The COCK CROWED. This was a great scene with Mat and how good he is with knives and how many knives he has like Thom! A great scene. Mat is awesome.</p>
        
        <p>Rand… YES! I’m so glad that we are getting Rand chapters again. This was an awesome scene. Berelain trying to be sexy haha. And I was certain Rand was going to do something with Berelain, but obviously not! So, the cock crowed again.. I loved this. This was another awesome scene. We are getting so many awesome scenes already. This is so good.</p>
        
        <h2>Chapter 3 - Reflection</h2>
        <p>This is some of the best Wheel of Time that I have read. This is amazing. Rand is hurt and Perrin is there to help, and Moraine and Lan, and some Aiel, and the Prophesies. This is just so good. I am blown away by this book so far. Emotional impact at a 5 right now for me. Plot a 5 as well, so far.</p>
        
        <h2>Chapter 4 - Strings</h2>
        <p>Mat and Thom, back again! Wow do I love the Wheel of Time and this book. This is so much fun to read, I've read so much of these characters - I feel like I know them and it's so great. Alright, Mat is t'averen and wow so much is happening. I believe that this bubble is happening because the boys are t'averen; it's gotta be. Because these things only happened to the three boys. Oh oh, and Thom still playing the Game of Houses... I am really enjoying that!</p>

        <h2>Chapter 5 - Questioners</h2>
        <p>I tell you what, this book just won't quit. BANGER after BANGER of chapters. The hits keep coming. This is so good. Okay, we've got Egwene and Nynaeve completely taking over Amico and Joiya (I'm sure that's hard for Egwene), and it's great to see. But let's talk about this plan that Joiya brings up because, oh wow does that seem scary and completely possible to happen. Where is Liandrin (we don't know!), and can she really do this with Mazrim Taim? I don't think Joiya is lying at all, because this plan is FLESHED OUT. There is not.. "uh and this", it is "1,2,3, and Rand a'l Thor, and The Dragon Reborn, and 4,5..." wow. This is good. Well, bad for Rand, but good for the story!</p>

        <h2>Chapter 6 - Doorways</h2>
        <p>A great chapter, not much action, but a great time. Moiraine talking of Prophecies and what they are all to do. And more talk of sa'angrael, and ter', and angraels. So cool. I really like this magic system and this world is so big and I'm so excited to read more!</p>

        <h2>Chapter 7 - Playing With Fire</h2>
        <p>This was a nice chapter. We got some saidin and saidar work and that was awesome to see. I really appreciate how Rand is not mad yet, I love to see him acting as we got in TEOTW and TGH - it is great for me and great for the story. Although I have no idea when the madness is going to come to pass. I love Elayne and Egwene, and I'm happy to see them trying to help Rand - because someone needs to. There really needs to be someone to come around Rand and help him figure it out and it cannot be Balzamon.... oh no, we haven't gotten any dream sequences yet - I'm sure we are gearing up for a big one soon. Onto the next chapter now!</p>

        <h2>Chapter 8 - Hard Heads</h2>
        <p>Alright Elayne and Rand! I SHIP! Love these two together and I really love how RJ wrote this scene. It was very genuine and I appreciated it a lot. Also, I love how Rand is when it comes to these High Lords. Really holding his own! And Mat and Egwene… okay, so Egwene and Elayne have started (I guess it’s not just been this book but..) doing things very brashly and without concern for the consequences- last chapter I was actually worried they might accidentally still Rand or something… obviously not, I’m on book four. But still, and the same with this chapter. Egwene is just telling Mat about the doorway after Moiraine told her not to tell anyone! Ahh! But still loving the book and excited to see what happens next!</p>

        <h2>Chapter 9 - Decisions</h2>
        <p>Okay, before I talk about Chapter 9, I must ask a question.. is there anything on the planet that is better than the Wheel of Time? I mean, any book series, any TV show, any movie franchise? Anything? Because I currently can think of nothing that is better than this book series. Wow, I am enthralled and cannot take my eyes of these pages. Wow.</p>

        <p>Okay, a lot here.. this chapter actually jumped around a bit with no breaks for perspective changes, so that was a little jarring but whoa a lot here. Okay, Mat is going down to the docks (definitely not leaving), Perrin is trying to find a way out for Faile (I can't wait for another Perrin chapter), Egwene isn't learning anything new from Joiya and Amico, Nynaeve is spending as much time as possible with Lan (SHIP!), and Elayne and Rand are spending as much time as possible (SHIP!) - love that!, and Rand continuing to be awesome in the face of these High Lords, and now.. Lanfear. Whoa. Okay, let's chat.</p>

        <p>Forsaken are now "Chosen" - I like that! I think I'd heard that before so I was a little spoiled, but that's okay because this is an awesome reveal of Lanfear coming out to Rand about her whole plan. I'm very interested to see what happens with Rand and Asmodean (I've also been spoiled about him.. but I won't spoil here), and this is just a great scene all together. Rand (LTT) and Lanfear, wow. I am at a lose for words, this is so good! I really appreciate the story progression here. I'm glad Rand knows who Selene is now and this is just a great story that I'm excited to see unfold in many more books! I can't believe there are so many more books truly - this is amazing. And then the Gray Man comes in the room... oh no! I have glanced at the next chapter and I see that some Aiel are dead.. oh no..</p>

        <h2>Chapter 10 - The Stone Stands</h2>
        <p>This was a great chapter! Rand against Fades and Trollocs and then getting Callandor (whoa!) awesome stuff with this lightning. And I got spoiled for the “now” voice, so I don’t know when we are supposed to find out what that is.. but I know what it is so that stinks. But that’s okay, still great!</p>

        <h2>Chapter 11 - What Lies Hidden</h2>
        <p>Ah, TAR! A little confusing chapter here, of course (had to be - it's TAR!). But, this was great to see Egwene in TAR and I loved it. I'm really happy to see what happens with Egwene in TAR, and I'm really interested to know what's going on in Tanchico - also Amys the.. Wise One? (are we sure she's a Wise One?). I think so, because she's going to Rhuidian and OH BOY ARE WE GOING TO GO TO RHUIDIAN! She asked Egwene to go to the Three Fold Land, so we've got to go to the Aiel Waste.. right? WOOOO!</p>

        <h2>Chapter 12 - Tanchico or the Tower</h2>
        <p>Okay so that's how Rand is going to marry the multiple women? "Sister-wives" from Min's vision of Rand with three women. Gosh, this is a great story - I'm interested to see what happens next. These chapters are good chapters for worldbuilding and plot building as well. This is good. Okay, wow. I read more of this chapter after I wrote this and whoa! Joiya and Amico = dead! Wow. I didn’t expect that. And Amys + a bunch of Wise One Dreamwalkers asked of Aviendha prior to her being in Tear (wow). And let me get this straight.. Nynaeve and Elayne are going to Tanchico? And Egwene and probably Aviendha will be going to Rhuidien, right? Right now Aviendha hasn’t said she’s going just yet.</p>

        <h2>Chapter 13 - Rumors</h2>
        <p>Holy cow, this is a great book. A Mat chapter (yes!), and what a good chapter. This is crazy, what is going to happen with the White Cloaks + Padan Fain (ordieth)... I'm not ready for any Two River Folk to die.. I'm not. And I just love Mat chapters. This door.. I wonder.</p>

        <h2>Chapter 14 - Customs of Mayene</h2>
        <p>Another amazing chapter. This book is so good. There is some great stuff here between Perrin and Berelain and Faile. From another of Min's vision - Wolf with falcon and hawk.. Perrin - Faile - Berelain (right?!). A great scene of Faile and Berelain and Rhuarc wow.. loved it! Excited to read the next chapter - Into the Doorway!</p>

        <h2>Chapter 15 - Into the Doorway</h2>
        <p>Well, Of course Mat had to go into the doorway. I have no idea where the places are with the spires or trees (that remind me of a weeping willow??). But here were his answers - Go to Rhuidean, or you will die. Sidestepped the thread of fate. To marry the daughter of the nine moons** (who is that??). To die and live again? He didn’t like those answers. HOLY COW. RAND AND MORAINE STEP OUT OF THE DOORWAY.</p>

        <p>Ahhhhhh! So much is happening in this chapter. Also, are these yellow people like the Wheel of Timers (like this people in MCU that watch the line of reality for variants??). Wow, the Old Tongue. Is Mat really a reincarnation too? Because that would be awesome, and is Perrin too? Is that what ta’veren is?? The pattern weaves around you, because you’ve already been apart of the pattern?</p>

        <p>I can’t believe this book series, this is so awesome. Also, I missed - to give up half the light of the world to save the world (from Mat’s time in the doorway) - I don’t have a better name for that yet.</p>

        <p>Also 15 I would like to know who these people are, I’m assume they’re just from another part of the world and when you walk through the doorway, you “teleport” (for lack of a better word yet… maybe Travel (capital T?). But also, I really want to know what Moraine and Rand asked!</p>

        <h2>Chapter 16 - Leavetakings</h2>
        <p>Okay so, now it’s official Lan and Nynaeve.. SHIP! Well not “official” just a kiss happened on the page, that’s step one. My prediction is Lan and Nynaeve will get together - as to how, I have no idea. Also, woo Loial!</p>

        <h2>Chapter 17 - Deceptions</h2>
        <p>This is amazing. I care so much for all these characters. It’s amazing because it is all these characters, every single one - I’m so interested to see what happens with each character. When I’m missing one, I’ll get something from another. Thom and his Game of Houses tricks.. so cool. And Moiraine definitely asked about Thom in the Doorway (still don’t know a name for it). That was one of her questions - about Thom (I’m guessing).</p>

        <p>Now Min! Woo! I’m glad to be back with Min in Tar Valon. Okay, let’s talk Galad… is he going to join the White Cloaks?! And I’m pretty sure all White Cloaks are not dark friends, but (I might need a refresher to White Cloaks) I’m pretty sure they don’t like male channelers right? RJ is putting on this White Cloak joining pretty hard. LOGAIN!</p>

        <p>Okay, Min with Amarliyn now. And whoa - there is a lot here that Siuan says, about the world and all the bad thing going on. And Logain, okay - I heard in a recent episode of the podcast (ep 405) Dani said that Logain might train Rand. And in Min's vision of Logain here, she sees that Logain will have glory. Could it be?! I am interested - I was scared of Logain, even though he's been gentled, I was scared when Egwene and Elayne walked into him in Book Two maybe or Book Three (hard to remember).</p>

        <p>Now the letters.. why haven't any of Moiraine's letters gotten to Siuan? I can believe that a letter finally got to Siuane so now she can talk about Rand being the Dragon Reborn, but just interesting there isn't much else from Moirane. And now this Mazrim escaping.. was Joiya's plan the truth?! OH NO! Also, also, Sahra now! WHO KILLED HER?? Is this the killing in the White Tower that Min saw early in this book?!?!</p>

        <h2>Chapter 18 - Into the Ways</h2>
        <p>I have no idea what is happening with the Stone trembling.. is it really Rand (like Perrin says)? And okay, I wish Faile and Perrin would make up lol. And I’m a little confused why the Stedding has vanished? I hope we’ll learn about that later. And now we get to the Waygate! I love the description of the Waygates and now, the Ways.. the doorway is a a faint mirror! Why was Machin Shin towards Rand in The Great Hunt! I don’t know! Can’t wait to read more and figure out Rand’s plans!</p>

        <h2>Chapter 19 - Wavedancer</h2>
        <p>AHHHH! SO MUCH WORLDBUILDING AND I LOVE IT. THE SEAFOLK. SO MUCH DECORUM FROM THE SEAFOLK. I LOVE IT SO MUCH. This is just great, I'm really excited to get this much worldbuilding from one chapter, and we finally see the Sea Folk and I am just loving this chapter and this book. Wow. Also, what just happened?! I have to read on!</p>

        <h2>Chapter 20 - Wind Rises</h2>
        <p>Well I’m still amazed. This was an awesome chapter! Got some incredible world building.. AGAIN! It just keeps coming and it really shows the power of this story. Also, Thom says 1-2 years before the Age is over?! Really? That seems hard to believe, because I’d expected this story to span many years, but it seems like we’d probably span 3-4 years total (right?) if the 1-2 years left is right? Maybe I’m looking too closely into what Thom was saying. And what is Elayne going to do when she finds out who Thom really is?! And the Windfinder is a channeler, that’s great! And I’m excited to see Elayne learn more! Also Juilien… nice right? Hopefully he doesn’t do anything bad this time - I do trust Lan more than anyone else.</p>

        <h2>Chapter 21 - Into the Heart</h2>
        <p>Holy absolute moly. My goodness gracious. If I could, I’d jump out of bed with my sleeping wife and jump up and down screaming so much joy. When it was setup and described of Rand walking in with the Aiel I was blown away. Good GRIEF. That was so awesome! And then the rest of this was also good too lol. And I’m interested to see what happens with Callandor now! And Rand is going to Rhuidean too, this is going to be awesome! I was also very happy to be in a Moiraine perspective! And the next chapter is a Portal Stone image - I am screaming! I can’t wait to see what happens next! AHHH</p>

        <h2>Chapter 22 - Out of the Stone</h2>
        <p>Holy crap. Another good, no great, chapter. Rand back to the same Rand we knew from book one and two and now so much more powerful. Lying to the team (trying to save face) and really confident in himself. This is great. I’m so interested to see what happens next and I love Mat’s comment “Bloody flaming light!”  So good!</p>

        <h2>Chapter 23 - Beyond the Stone</h2>
        <p>A lot happened this chapter. And it was great! Wow. Okay, so first off, Rand got all of them to the Aiel Waste! That’s awesome and really shows this power. Now we get the Wise Ones and more here - wow there really is a lot this chapter. Okay, so I love the exchange of Rand and Mat with the Wise Ones - also Rand's father.... oh boy! Okay, now Aviendha WOW! She can channel, I thought so - but that is awesome. I can't believe we are getting Rand + Mat + Aviendha + Moiraine in Rhuidean. Wow. That is so cool, I can't wait. AND NOW Rhuidean has the Three Ring ter'angreal too... interesting...... I can't wait to see what they see. Now, I didn't read that Rand and Mat have to walk through too - do they have to?? Also, I hear Chapter 25+26 I will need to read 4 times. Twice through and then Twice through from 26+25. Here we go!</p>

        <h2>Chapter 24 - Rhuidean</h2>
        <p>This is beautiful and beautifully written. I'm a little confused, of course, because why isn't Aviendha near Rand and Mat? Also, Moiraine - not near anyone either? THIS IS GOING TO BE SO GOOD. Okay, so The Tree of Life! Nice. And Mat, I'm worried about him.. oh no. Also, why walk into the doorway again?! And what is going on?!</p>

        <h2>Chapter 25 - The Road to the Spear</h2>
        <p>Okay, I'm confused of course but that's okay - because this is awesome. Alright, let me see if can understand this. So Rand steps into the glass columns and he is.. taken back in time as an Aielman - first as Mandein a young sept cheif and we see a scene play out where he and a few Aiel chiefs meet with different septs.. right? the Jenn, Dermon, Mordaine, and Narisse - and there are Aes Sedai there too. Talk of Prophecy and aha! Mandein was the first chief to agree to go to Rhuidean.. got it. Rand has some confusion regarding the Jenn Aiel.</p> 

        <p>Then Rand comes back and then becomes Rhodric who is an Aiel but not the Jenn Aiel - and these Aiel haven't been beyond the Dragonwall yet. NICE!</p>

        <p>Then Rand is Lewin, and this is a great scene where Lewin's clan(?) comes to try to save one of their children - and he accidentally kills the people as do the other Aiel. When he gets back his mother and father (Adan) tell him he is no longer.. Da'shain (not sure what that means yet) and they are no longer welmoe at the wagons of the Aiel. But, Lewin still thinks "I am still Aiel!". Rand is very close to Muradin now (who was in Rhuidean before Rand and Mat came). Now to Chapter 26.</p>

        <h2>Chapter 26 - The Dedicated</h2>
        <p>Good gracious. Wow. This. was. amazing. What just happened? I am in shock - I need a Healing please. Wow. I cannot find the words to describe how I feel right now. I wanted some more of that time when we kept going further and further back. That was great! Wow. Okay, a lot to digest here. So, the Aiel followed the Dragon and not Aes Sedai (got it - right?), and they also followed the Way of the Leaf (confused Matt here), and I loved the scene with the Nym and the Ogier and the singing! OH MY GOSH AND THE FLYING CARS AND PLANES AND WHAT?! HOW?! WHEN?! WHAT HAPPENED?! Wow, this was amazing. Okay, let me try to digest this - and don't think we have the answer yet, unless I missed it (totally possible). I don't think we know how the Aiel started from the Way of the Leaf to transition to what they are now, unless it was just years and years of being taken advantage of - it can't be that simple. But so much happened truly. I also loved the last blip of Rand as Charn.. and the new source of the One Power (WHAT THE HECK IS THAT?!). Please help.</p>

        <p>Wait wait wait.. is Somestra the Nym THE GREEN MAN? AND THE TASK FOR HIM WAS THE EYE OF THE WORLD - When Rand as Joani was in the Hall of the Servants AND THAT'S WHAT THEY CREATED WHEN THEY SANG - WE SAW THE EYE OF THE WORLD BEING MADE?! MY BRAIN IS BROKEN.</p>

        <h2>Chapter 27 - Within the Ways</h2>
        <p>Difficult to top the previous chapters, and I almost thought about skimming until... TROLLOCS AND A FADE IN THE WAYS AND MACHIN SHIN! I still know barely anything about Machin Shin and how and who it targets or if it is truely sentient or can be controlled... Also, the wolves.. where are they? And who shot the bird??</p>

        <h2>Chapter 28 - To the Tower of Ghenjei</h2>
        <p>A WOLF DREAM! Sweet, I like it when Perrin dreams. Alright my immediate questions - Are the Aelfinn and Eelfinn the people who answer the questions in the Door'angrael (as Dani said in ep 412)? They gotta be... snake like and fox people.. gotta be. Okay, these sky visions - Rand going mad.. I hope not too soon, Nynaeve and Elayne obviously in Tanchico, Mat with his staff and blade... yep saw that, Egwene and woman with white hair looking at Perrin (they're probably also in TAR and they show up because they're checking on him!). I'm so smart... we'll see.</p> 

        <p>Okay this woman and this "Slayer". I have no idea who this woman is and this Slayer... no idea either!</p>

        <h2>Chapter 29 - Homecoming</h2>
        <p>Well quite the homecoming for Perrin... golly! I'm crying, Perrin's crying, Faile's crying. Gosh, this is a tough chapter wow. Perrin's whole family is dead - gosh! And Tam and Abel are hiding nearby - good. Okay, so I can only imagine what the Whitecloaks are trying to do... and Fain... ahh! Okay so Lord Luc has to be... Asmodeon? I know we've heard of him before and I'm just guessing it's him because all these Forsaken(Chosen) are taking over these High Lord places.. we'll see. So sad for Perrin.</p>

        <h2>Chapter 30 - Beyond the Oak</h2>
        <p>Okay another Perrin chapter in the Two Rivers.. okay - tbh I really want to get back to Rand but RJ is keeping these chapters interesting with these mysterious endings. I have no idea what Aes Sedai that are suspected to be in this building.. Verin maybe? I'm trying to remember - it could be a completely new Aes Sedai we've not met! Also, I do still care about the Two Rivers, it just isn't as exciting as Rand and Mat in Rhuidean!</p>

        <h2>Chapter 31 - Assurances</h2>
        <p>Whoa. Okay so Abel and Tam killed the Ravens.. interesting! I love this Tam and Abel and Perrin dynamic. Also, so glad we got Verin! And this Alanna, I don’t like her. But she’s a Green Ajah! And Dain is really not liking Ordieth, obviously, and omg Ordieth/Fain killed Perrin’s family!!! Also, wow, the accent shifting is for sure Fain/Mordeth wow. Okay, whoa another Fain perspective! And holy crap he is scary! And this Fade - I definitely thought it wasn’t going to be a fade. I’m interested why he has a Fade and won’t release him. Maybe to learn how to bind with Trollocs without needing a Fade?? That would be BAD!</p>

        <h2>Chapter 32 - Questions to be Asked</h2>
        <p>I tell you what, every single chapter in this book - yes all 32 so far, have had something good or great in them! I have been hooked since page one and I'm loving it. I'm really loving seeing Perrin back in the Two Rivers with his past since leaving and his past since before leaving, it is great to read! I am glad Perrin is sharing these things with those who knew him in the Two Rivers, and I love the bits of jealousy from Perrin and Faile with the boys and girls of the al'Seen farm. Also, this Laila is apparently the Laila from the WOT Show on Amazon Prime, at least that's my guess because here Perrin says "I dreamed of marrying her" and in the show they are married. Neat! Alright, time to meet this Lord Luc, and I'm excited to see what happens next chapter because it's called A New Weave in the Pattern.... oh boy!</p>

        <h2>Chapter 33 - A New Weave in the Pattern</h2>
        <p>GO PERRIN! WOO! Okay, this is again, another awesome chapter and Perrin is really taking charge here, and I'm a little dissappointed we are leaving off on a bit of cliff hanger, but I'm excited to get back to Rand and Mat coming out of Rhuidean. SO! Who the heck is this Lord Luc?! I love Verin - she's the best. I'm really proud of Perrin and the way he is taking charge, and I'm excited to see what happens next. I love the way the Two Rivers Folk are just banding together and are about to do some work! I loved the scene of Perrin and Faile sneaking through the camp - so good. Just all so good!</p>

        <h2>Chapter 34 - He Who Comes With the Dawn</h2>
        <p>Okay holy crap. SO SO MUCH. Alright, so Rand is.. He Who Comes with the Dawn! I think I figured that, but RJ had some things that could’ve been different and it wouldn’t be Rand - but of course it’s Rand! And whoa!! Twin Dragon tattoos on his arms! I’ve seen that in fan art and such, but this is absolutely awesome to see in writing. Okay, so do everyone that goes into Rhuidean get BOTH tattoos (for lack of a better term - is there a specific term for this?) or do they get just one on their left arm? I know Rhuarc has at least one of his left arm.</p>

        <p>Now, Shaiel and Janduin are Rand’s parents! Also, Rhuidean are your ancestors visions - meaning Rand’s ancestors (and I think this) started The Tinkers (right?) and the Aiel! Wow, that’s amazing. Okay so these parents, I just want more of this about them and I’m excited to get to the podcast episode on this because Dani and Brett will surely explain this for me - I do also expect that we’ll get more about the parents.</p>

        <p>And Rand is going to be the Chief of Chiefs to unite ALL AIEL! That is so exciting. Wow this was a huge chapter. Wow. And I’m so excited to read on and I can’t even believe there is over 400 pages left in this book AND THEN 10 MORE BOOKS AFTER THIS!?</p>

        <p>More for my notes too: Aviendha and Moiraine make it back! Aviendha looks like she's upset with Rand. And, Rand has a half-brother.</p>

        <h2>Chapter 35 - Sharp lessons</h2>
        <p>This was a nice chapter, got Elayne and Egwene in TAR and then this Aiel Women’s Business meeting in an Aiel sauna, super cool. And I’m just really having a great time. Aviendha going to listen and help Rand, what could go wrong??</p>

        <h2>Chapter 36 - Misdirections</h2>
        <p>OH NO THE LANFEAR PICTURE, yet no Lanfear... at least yet! oh wow, wait, are these two going to be Lanfear and a Forsaken?? - Kadere and Keille?! Also, Rand is missing Min.. aw lol. And Aviendha is hanging by Rand and I think that's neat, I hope it goes well for them. Also there are A LOT OF AIEL and I just can't imagine what that looks like, how scary?! And, I believe Rand this man's eyes are showing something dangerous... oh no.</p>

        <p>Mat has a hat now.</p>

        <h2>Chapter 37 - Imre Stand</h2>
        <p>Rand figures out Aviendha has passed through Rhuidean to be a Wise One! Rand / Lan / Rhuarc are training together. Mat is having these little visions of memories from previous time from someone else's point of view.. a little confusing of course! Mat is for some reason telling this Gleeman of what has happened while leaving out some details. Now the Gleeman starts singing....</p>

        <h2>Chapter 38 - Hidden Faces</h2>
        <p>I tell you what, if you've never heard RJ say that he believed the Seanchan had Southern Accents - this chapter really brings that home when Gelb tells Egeanin that her accent is strange saying "beg your pardon, no offence meant"! SO GOOD, that is clearly a southern accent. Okay, so a lot happening here and this is the Seanchan person under Suroth and plans are being made and Gelb has been tasked with, I'm assuming, finding Egwene, Nynaeve, and Elayne.. maybe.</p>

        <p>Next is Jaichim Carradin and he is... BORS from the TGH prolouge confirmed woo! Well, not woo for his whole family. And Liandrin wow, she's tough. I'm guessing they want the Panarch's Palace because it has some sa', ter', and an'greals? or maybe a Waygate? IDK! Exciting stuff!</p>

        <p>And now, we're in Liandrin's head... oh no! And who, that was a lot too! We’re getting a lot about the Aes Sedai here, at least the Ajahs we kind of know Green, White, Brown, Yellow. But I can’t wait to learn more because that’s not seven! Or let’s see. Blue (uh, on missions for something I can’t think of right now), Red (hate men - not sure their purpose), Green (strong and love men, take multiple warders), Brown (researchers / history), Yellow (healers), White, Black (does that count? Is that the last ajah?)? But anyway, I’m the Palace they’re looking for a ter’angrael to control Rand! I wonder what that is?</p>

        <p>Back to Egeanin, and RJ in this book is just completely flexing his World Building muscles like no other. This is amazing! And okay, now we’ve got these Truth Seekers and a sul’dam held in her basement because she can channel too. And we know now how Seanchan recruit, which is scary but awesome.</p> 

        <h2>Chapter 39 - A Cup of Wine</h2>
        <p>Now this was a good chapter. However, *trigger warning - sexual assault*. Now there was a lot that happened in this chapter, and for one - I was really nervous that Elayne was going to be assaulted. I was absolutely terrified that this was how this was going to go - with this handsome man had put something in her drink and was why she was acting the way she was - not drunk. But as I continued reading, I was pleasently surprised that it was from alcohol and not something else.</p>

        <p>So, anyways, this was a great chapter with TAR and we found out in the book it was Birgitte who was in TAR. And this strange man has to be Slayer!!</p>

        <p>Also, Elayne being drunk can't touch the True Source or Channel!</p>

        <h2>Chapter 40 - Hunter of Trollocs</h2>
        <p>Wow Perrin, oh no! This was a tough chapter, I couldn't believe what happened! And okay, let's talk about Lord Luc - who or what is he?! Perrin smells that he doesn't smell human.... what could that mean?! And I feel bad for Perrin and crew because just when we see things are going well, and then the Trollocs come and Perrin is HURT - I'm sure he'll be Healed soon but still. And now we're going to get some happy people, so that is good too. Onto Chapter 41!</p>

        <h2>Chapter 41 - Among the Tua'tha'an</h2>
        <p>WOW This chapter was amazing! Too short if you ask me. We've got the Aiel not wanting to sleep near "The Lost Ones" - from the Rhuidean visions of the Aiel / Tinker split! And Faile telling her story and Perrin telling his story! WOW! And I love this Wolf King, that is great! In an effor to read another chapter I'll come back for notes later.. onto the next!</p>

        <p>What I love about this section is the way it shows how both of these groups consider each other "Lost", and they're all both right and wrong.  The Tu'atha'an consider the (modern) Aiel lost for abandoning the Way of the Leaf and the (modern) Aiel consider the Tu'atha'an lost because they abandoned the wagons and their duty to protect the cache for the Aes Sedai.  Both groups are lost, they just don't see it in themselves.</p>

        <h2>Chapter 42 - A Missing Leaf</h2>
        <p>Well wow wow wow, Perrin and Faile wink wink ;). Alright, let's talk about this Slayer dream... hmm. So Slayer knows that Perrin is being called Goldeneyes, and I'm confused, but that happenes. But boy oh boy - this is just amazing! The Wolf banner!! That is awesome! And just for keeping up on the story - the Waygate has been opened?! I don't konw how that's possible, and I'm just so interested in TAR and Slayer and Perrin's Wolfdreams (is that just Perrin being a Dreamwalker??). This is amazing.</p>

        <h2>Chapter 43 - Care of the Living</h2>
        <p>Was there anything that happened this chapter? I know Perrin is about to get Healed, and it seemed BAD before he was being Healed. Loial has a HUGE axe and it was “his fault” with the Waygate and hmm 13 Aes Sedai and a terangreal 500 years after the breaking.. and then almost destroying the Waygate with 9. Hmmmmm. 13 Forsaken??</p>

        <p>To answer your question, though, ||the Breaking of the World basically ended the Age of Legends.  It started when LTT sealed the Bore and the Dark One lashed out and tainted saidin.  All the male Aes Sedai went mad from this, and they literally changed the face of the earth before they were all put down.  The Forsaken were caught in the sealing of the Bore, which is what locked them away until recently.  Aginor and Balthamel were sealed closest to reality, which is why they aged in a way that Lanfear hasn't.</p>

        <p>That caused LTT and all of his companions to go mad instantly, and all other male Aes Sedai to go mad slowly.  The crazy things they did with the Power as they went insane are what raised oceans into mountains (and vice versa) and completely reshaped the world and became known as the Breaking. 🙂</p>

        <h2>Chapter 44 - The Breaking Storm</h2>
        <p>Okay, see now I like this dynamic with Faile and Perrin - not the whole beginning stuff with the not talking to each other and her beating up Perrin after he asked her to stop. But this, I can get behind.</p>

        <p>Okay, these Trollocs and these catapults - AWESOME! I love Perrin taking charge. Also I love that people see it happening and they believe in Perrin.</p>

        <p>The footsteps at the end.. I’m guessing the Whitecloaks!</p>

        <h2>Chapter 45 - Tinker with a Sword</h2>
        <p>This is just great, a little boring after the last 40 or so chapters of something exciting happening. But this is good! Perrin is really coming around as a leader here and really setting up Emond’s Field for success in battles to come! I love it! I haven’t finished the chapter yet, just to want to chat about Perrin! Okay, yes - I agree with Dani and Brett this is Perrin's sidequest chapter. But this Tinker with a Sword! That's clearly directly from Min's vision of Perrin right? Or at least the beginning of the viewing for Perrin from...TDR ch6! I do believe this isn't the whole viewing, but at least the start! Woo! Okay, let's try not to think about what Perrin just did bringing in the Whitecloaks.. let's ignore that for now..</p>

        <h2>Chapter 46 - Veils</h2>
        <p>Okay, so a good chapter here! With definitely a FORSAKEN TALKING TO NYNAEVE AND ELAYNE! I love the multiple perspective chapters. Egeanin, I'm really liking her and I don't know why, she's so interesting because she has a lot she doesn't know - even though she's Seanchan.. I don't know, we hate the Seanchan. So, who could this Forsaken be with Nynaeve and Elayne? I think it's Moghedien that Lanfear mentioned in a previous chapter! And what a cool power.. Jedi mind tricks for sure. And I love Thom and Juilin being these girls "servants". I just like those boys. Here we go!</p>

        <h2>Chapter 47 - The Truth of a Viewing</h2>
        <p>Whoa. This popped off right from the start. Whoa, so much happened here. First off, Elaida is going crazy (not literally) but I have no idea what is going to happen now?! How could Elaida do that?? Okay, and Siuane and Leane are STILLED WHOA, WHAT?! And Min is there being awesome, love that - excited to see what happens next. And now Gawyn being a jerk, what the heck? Why would he do that? What is he going to do - he killed Warders because they supported Siuane. Yes, he doesn't know where Egwene or Elayne are but wow. And woo Logain! I'm interested to see what happens now. I really have no idea what to expect next? Also, this Min viewing of Gawyn breaking Egwene's neck or bowing in front of her? OH WHOA! EGWENE TO BECOME THE AMYRLIN? Could that be it?? Because of the vision that Egwene had in her Testing?? Wow RJ is great. The Wheel of Time is great. Wow.</p>

        <h2>Okay - so the story in The Shadow Rising up to Chapter 47...</h2>
        <p>Rand knows Lanfear is Lanfear now, and he knows the Shadow and the Forsaken are coming after him, Rand is leveling up big time with Callandor, Trolloc and Fade attack - Rand absolutely destroys them all with a lightning storm with LTT's voice coming into his head. Perrin and Faile become close (sleeping in the same room... ;)), and Berelain wants everyone to see her naked, except Mat because they're too much the same. The Hunters Three (Egwene, Nynaeve, and Elayne) question Amico and Joiya - then Amico and Joiya tell a plan that is supposed to happen with Mazrim Taiem, then Amico and Joiya are killed after the Trolloc attack. Mat is getting very lucky ;). There is a ter'angreal doorway that Mat, Rand, and Moirane go through. Mat is told he needs to go to Rhuidean (as do Egwene, Rand, and Moirane). Elayne and Nynaeve are to go to Tanchico to find the Black Ajah. Also, Min is pretending to be Elmindreda (Min just wearing makeup), and she's stuck at the White Tower.</p>

        <p>Rand, Moirane, Mat, and A LOT OF AIEL go to Rhuidean through a Portal Stone (AWESOME!). Nynaeve, Elayne, Thom, and Juilin Sandar go to Tanchico on a Sea Folk Ship (Wavedancer). Perrin, Faile, Gaul, and Loial (oh yeah Loial still exists..), go through the Ways to go back to the Two Rivers because apparently Whitecloaks and Padan Fain are there.</p>

        <p>Rand goes to Rhuidean and comes out with two Dragon tattoos (one on each arm, identical) and is proclaimed He Who Comes with the Dawn! This was incredible. Now Rand has to unite all the Aiel as He Who Comes with the Dawn, but according to Prophecy, Rand being WHCWTD will also destroy the Aiel. Also, the Aiel started out as the Tinkers (Tu'atha'an - the Way of The Leaf) until a tragedy struck and desperation called for an Aiel to kill someone in self defense. Also Rand's ancestor's are some that started the Maiden's of the Spear, and more. A LOT ACTUALLY HAPPENS WITH RAND.</p>

        <p>Turns out, Whitecloaks and Padan Fain are there. Padan Fain has killed Perrin's family (wow Padan Fain). And Perrin is becoming a leader in the Two Rivers, he is awesome with leading them as a bit of a General and they make a Wolf Banner for him! Then we see the Tinker with a Sword (Aram - apart of Min's Viewing in the Dragon Reborn). Perrin and Faile love each other. I don't like this Lord Luc.</p>

        <p>Elayne, Nynaeve, Thom, and Juilin are in Tanchico and are close to finding the Black Ajah. This has only been a small part of the story so far. We also see a perspective of Egeanin who is of the Seanchan. I'm interested to see if they actually find the Black Ajah.. they're close!</p>

        <p>We're also seeing a lot of the Forsaken.. scary!</p>

        <p>Min and Siuane, whoa. The White Tower has been attacked and Siuane (Amyrlin Seat.. was) and Leane (Keeper of the Chronicals.. was) have had their roles taken from them and they've been STILLED by Elaida and some other followers of Elaida. Those probably think the Amyrlin shouldn't Proclaim Rand as the Dragon Reborn but that has already been Proclaimed! Gawyn DOES NOT LIKE SIUANE.</p>

        <h2>Chapter 48 - An Offer Refused</h2>
        <p>Well maybe I missed it, but I do not believe anything happened in this chapter. Natael talked with Rand, Aviendha can channel now, Egwene isn't wearing the braids anymore, Mat is trying to kiss some women. I do not trust a single one of these peddlers, not a one.</p>

        <h2>Chapter 49 - Cold Rocks Hold</h2>
        <p>This was a great chapter! More of the Aiel customs, and Rand being Rand as He Who Comes With the Dawn just trying to figure out his role. I love the banter with Rand and Aviendha! And with the roofmistress and Rhuarc. This is just great!</p>

        <h2>Chapter 50 - Traps</h2>
        <p>Okay, whoa. A lot here. Love this. Alright, I absolutely love Rand learning, well actually just listening to Aviendha talk about Aiel customs, I can't stop smiling as I read this. It's great! I'm really happy we're getting bits and pieces of what RJ is forshadowing, I can't wait to see what happens next. And then BOOM A DREAM SEQUENCE!</p>

        <p>Let's talk.</p>
        <p>This is definitely Lanfear (for some reason Rand doesn't know that's it's Lanfear??)</p>

        <p>The shimmer has to be, stick with me here - Asmodean or Rhavin.. because Lanfear recently has mentioned those names and maybe they're just shimmering blurring so Rand doesn't see them (that part I don't know about). I first suspected this was LTT, but then quickly realized that's not the case. Although, this could be Slayer (whoever that is?). And Lanfear also mentioned the Spider (capital S), I'm guessing that's Moghedien because in the sentence prior Lanfear mentioned her.</p>

        <p>Well good gracious this chapter absolutely exploded! Dragkhar attacks and more Trollocs and Wise One's dead. Whoa! I do not want Rand to go mad. It seems to be getting worse, and I don't know how to stop it! But Rand is awesome with this One Power Fire Sword and now these bars of fire that come out of the Sword, wiked! Mat being awesome as well, and Aviendha being scared of Rand - that was neat to see.</p>

        <p>So much is happening, and apparently one of the Wise One's (Melaine) was going to lay a.. bridal wreath! That's what Sevanna did to Suladric to wed them! And that's what Melaine was going to say to Rand... interesting!</p>

        <p>Okay, and Rand and Mat and more Aiel are going straight to Alcair Dal and not waiting the month.. I didn't think Rand would do that anyway.</p>

        <h2>Chapter 51 - Revelations in Tanchico</h2>
        <p>A nice chapter! I really like the succinctness of RJ's writing in this chapter. We get a lot of info - with Thom, Bayle, and Juilin going around the city. I like it. Also, thank goodness Nynaeve and Elayne know that Egeanin is Seanchan now. And now we're going into TAR. And for certain, something is going to happen with Nynaeve asleep, Elayne nearly asleep, and Egeanin about to be asleep. I don't know what is going to happen but something is going to happen!</p>

        <h2>Chapter 52 - Need</h2>
        <p>HOLY CRAP. CRAP. DANI WAS RIGHT.</p>
        <p>"Dead? those of us who are bound to the wheel are not as others are dead. where better for us to wait until the wheel weaves us out in new lives than in the world of dreams?" Birgitte said. HOLY ABSOLUTE CRAP. WOW. Okay wow. Also, Asmodean was the man in Rhuidean and Moghedien was the woman that Compelled Nynaeve and Elayne... I KNEW IT! WOW!</p>

        <p>Okay! So, a male a'dam type collar supposedly being the apsect of interest from the Black Ajah it seems and I can get behind that. That is almost certainly exactly what the Black Ajah would be looking for. Also, interesting that there is another cuendillar (dark one prison key).. hmm.</p>

        <p>And this NEED is apparently really important. Could this be a Talent used by Dreamwalkers?</p>

        <p>An exciting end to the chapter as well. Seanchan spy trying to.. talk to Egeanin. And the women have made a plan to get the things from the Black Ajah before they get them first! Woo!</p>

        <p>Oh wow, there are only 6 chapters left....</p>

        <h2>Chapter 53 - The Price of a Departure</h2>
        <p>I keep saying this but... HOLY CRAP! I'd like to start with this marriage.. how beautiful. Wow. Also, Faile using Zarine as her name.. interesting, right? or no? Anyways, wow Perrin - this was so nice!</p>

        <p>Okay, is Slayer Luc? I DON'T KNOW! It kind of has to be right? Or maybe RJ is throwing us off the trail, or maybe RJ is giving it to us on a plater? HMMMM.</p>

        <p>I'm interested to see what happens next, but whoa there aren't that many pages left and there are thousands of Trollocs around Emond's Field. WHAT IS GOING TO HAPPEN?!</p>

        <p>Probably going to get that next book, that's cool with me!</p>

        <p>5 CHAPTERS TO GO!</p>

        <h2>Chapter 54 - Into the Palace</h2>
        <p>WE ARE NOT SLOWING DOWN. HOLY MOLY. This was nonstop. Wow. I love Bayle Domon, I really do. I love this dynamic with Elayne, Nynaeve, and Egeanin with Thom, Juilin, and Bayle. They're fun to read together. And whoa, a lot happened THIS CHAPTER.</p>

        <p>Elayne, Nynaeve, and Egeanin sneaking into the Palace and seperating. Elayne and Egeanin finding Temaile and sheilding her (AWESOME!). The question is: how to get her out of the Palace (good question - I have no idea!). Next question, where did Marillin go?? Also, Elayne is LEVELING UP - thanks to the Sea Folk!</p>

        <p>Okay, Nynaeve - go Nynaeve WOW! So, this Moghedien fight, this was great! I was thinking (as was Nynaeve), about what this looked like from an outsider perspective of just two women staring at each other not moving and sweating.. lol. But anyways, Nynaeve is a beast! Literally matching Power and Strength with a Forsaken WHOA! That's awesome! And I'm just going to add this because this seems really important... *The sad bracelets were made after the Bore was sealed, but Moghedien learned about them in her research after she broke free. She was two hundred years old when the Bore was opened, young for Aes Sedai.* That's big, and I'm just saving that because that is breaking my brain with that world building, as is most of this book. But a good breaking of my brain - not that I don't understand, well I don't, but like I'll understand later is what I mean. And now, Nynaeve was able to Sheild Moghedien... WHOA!</p>

        <p>Now, Jeaine trying to stop Nynaeve with balefire from her ter'angreal. And somehow both Jeaine and Mo are gone?! WHAT?!</p>

        <p>AMAZING!</p>

        <p>4 CHAPTERS TO GO!</p>

        <h2>Chapter 55 - Into the Deep</h2>
        <p>Well well well, this book does not dissappoint. Even these small chapters with just talking it's impressive. I'm impressed, I'll say that. And as a lot of people, I feel like I want to write my own fantasy story now lol. But anyways, this is great! I love this dynamic of them all together (Nynaeve, Elayne, Egeanin (still skeptical of her), Thom, Juilin, and Bayle). They're so much fun to read! And about this collar... I don't think it's going to be safe at the bottom of the ocean, that is the start of so many movies - that something that people think is lost at sea is found randomly.. can't be safe down there!</p>

        <p>And it is very apparent that these people DO NOT KNOW THE TOWER HAS FALLEN!</p>

        <p>3 chapters to go... oh no, it's almost over!</p>

        <h2>Chapter 56 - Goldeneyes</h2>
        <p>>Well this was awesome! A BATTLE IN EMOND'S FIELD WITH PERRIN AT THE HELM?! AMAZING. This was great and epic and awesome. I love the Perrin and Faile relationship. I love how the guy who died in a previous chapter said "we are coming", I was terrified, I wasn't sure what that meant.. turns out it was people from Deven Ride to help save the day!</p>

        <p>Also, I think we knew that Trollocs spoke, but who or what is this ISAM?! I know in the Fain perspective he mentioned Isam being disappointed.. so it's a person at least.</p>

        <p>AMAZING!</p>

        <p>2 chapters to go!</p>

        <h2>Chapter 57 - A Breaking in the Three-fold Land</h2>
        <p>Good gracious! WOW! THIS WAS PERFECT. EVERYTHING. AHHHHHHH. COULADIN WHAT?! HOW?! THe real question is how? And I think that was sort of answered when Lanfear mentioned Asmodean using Couladin. But if he didn't go into Rhuidean? But he said he did? But did he?? AHH QUESTIONS!</p>

        <p>Okay, this rain, wow. Awesome Rand, go Rand! I feel the Aiel are going to love Rand for the rain.. hopefully. But okay, now Lanfear. Wow. And Rand using this folding of reality? That's such a cool way to describe this. I'm amazed. Amazed!</p>

        <p>1 chapter to go!</p>

        <h2>Chapter 58 - Traps in Rhuidean</h2>
        <p>Okay, wow. Holy CRAP! This is amazing. This was amazing! I love this so much. I can’t believe what I just read. I’m so happy. This is incredible.</p>

        <p>Okay, so I love this traveling, I don’t have a word for it yet - could be Traveling (capital T) from someone asking Rand if he’d learned to Travel?? Idk but it was incredible to read!!! I really like how Rand could just think different forms of travel.</p>

        <p>Okay, Asmodean, wow. This was awesome. I can’t stop saying that! I cannot believe this book series. How small was the detail of the black wires under his coat?? And THAT was what was tying him to the Dark One? Also Lanfear.. oh Meirin.. doing something to give him access to the One Power?? Is this something someone else can learn so people can be “unstilled” or “ungentled”?? Wow! And I’m glad Rand found both ter’angraels.</p>

        <p>Okay, Rhuidean! This is so great that Rand could bring water back and now Rhuidean can be rebuilt and be a real city again!!</p>

        <p>RAND HAS A TEACHER NOW! Rand was able to take Asmodean's link tot he dark one away and now he can teach him! I'm so excited!</p>

        <p>So SO GOOD!</p>
