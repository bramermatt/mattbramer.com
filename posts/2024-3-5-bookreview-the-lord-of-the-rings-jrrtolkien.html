            <h2>Currently Reading</h2>
            <p>I started reading, March 4, 2024! You can follow along on <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/user_status/show/797399678" target="_blank">Goodreads</a>! I also have a <a href="../../../pages/lotr-in-review.html">Lord of the Rings in Review</a>!</p>

            

            <h2>Written Review</h2>
            <p>This is a masterpiece. An absolute work of art. I am currently deeply invested in the world of Middle-Earth, and for good reason. This is spectacular! The characters are so deep, and the world-building feels so real. The magic is something to keep you thinking and guessing. The world history is something that seems to be spanning for ages, there is so much to discover. I LOVE IT!</p>
            
            <p>Spooky and scary! Absolutely breathtaking visuals, I must say! </p>

            <p>I can't beleive I've finally finished The Lord of the Rings! I am amazed and impressed by the story here, the prose, and the characters, and the plot are spectacular. One of my favorite books I've ever read, certainly!</p> 

            <p>There is so much to talk about in this story, and I am going to need some more time to finalize my thoughts, but I will say, WOO! I loved this story. Especially the One-Volume Edition, really great to be able to read this back to back, to back! And now I have the Appendixes to look at, now that is fun. I look forward to reading that and then diving into The Silmarillion!</p>

            <h2>The End of Books One & Two: The Fellowship of the Ring</h2>
            <p>I have completed The Fellowship of the Ring (<a href="../../../docs/fellowship-of-the-ring-book-review.html">The Fellowship of the Ring Book Review</a>) and I am absolutely impressed. I had read this book a couple of months ago, and I've read nearly 40 books since then. But now I'm back and ahh, I'm finding so much more to love! Such an incredible story and characters and world. I have always loved the movies and I'm so happy to be reading this story.</p>

            <p>Frodo is such a relatable character, I think, and I appreciate his actions and his thoughts. I love the multiple characters together in one story - it lends to a good story in my eyes. I like the passing back and forth between characters in conversations with specific personalities. You know these characters and you more than likely know what they're going to say. It is quite enjoyable to read when this happens.</p>

            <p>Description, walking, names, and sleeping. This is something that I'd heard a lot about when reading the Lord of the Rings, and that's true. It's all here. I feel like on every page, someone is sleeping. And that makes sense, this is a realistic journey, and I appreciate it. The plot is moving, there aren't many times that are being stalled on story just to sit and talk. Now, I say that, and we've had the Council of Elrond. One of the most incredible pieces of writing and exposition I've read. Backstory, flashbacks, and story progression. That's all I can ask for, and that's what the Council of Elrond gave me. I LOVED IT.</p>

            <p>Touchstones to the Hobbit, I appreciate that having just read the Hobbit. The songs, read them! There is history there, and world-building, so good. The prose is beautiful here. </p>

            <p>What more can I say? It is The Lord of the Rings?! Now, I have never read anything PAST The Fellowship of the Ring. I am holding the One-Volume Edition and I have The Two Towers next here, and then Return of the King. I am so excited to keep reading. I also have the Silmarillion next! I AM SO EXCITED!</p>

            <h2>The Ending of Books Three & Four: The Two Towers</h2>
            <p>Now that was an absolutely INCREDIBLE conclusion to The Two Towers. This was great! Scary, exciting, painful, and wonderful. I'm blown away by this book so far, there have been a lot of walking and sleeping, but that'll happen!</p>

            <p>I get it, and I love it! and that is something that keeps me coming back. I can't wait to turn each page, there is a lot going on and I appreciate the timeline of hwo this is written. </p>
                
            <p>Aragorn, Legolas, and Gimli start the first part (book three) and we see all that unfold, and then we come back to Sam, Frodo, and Gollum (book four) having come back in time (chronologically). So much goodness here. </p>
                
            <p>These characters are deep and smart and the magic is one of my favorite things to read in this story. It's good to get the world that you see when you're wearing the ring. Also, Gandalf is so awesome! </p>
                
            <p>I struggled with The Hobbit wondering that a lot happened in both the Hobbit and Lord of the Rings. BUT THAT IS NOT ENTIRELY THE CASE! Ah, you'll have to Read and Find Out the differences. But, I am certainly very happy with what I've read so far. </p>
                
            <p>Here we go onto Book Five & Six: Return of the King! </p>

            <h2>The Endings of Books Five & Six: The Return of the King</h2>
            <p>I'm not crying, you're crying: I love when people say that. This was my favorite of the three books of the Lord of the Rings.</p>

            <p>I couldn't get over nearly ever sentence in this book, such beautiful writings and such beautiful descriptions. My goodness, I needed to stop myself as I was writing in the Memorable Quotes section, because seriously, every sentence should be in there. Such good writings.</p>
                
            <p>I love a good pledging of fealty, and we get that in this book. Twice! Nay, THRICE! Ah, this is some great fantasy here. I love it. </p>
                
            <p>I will say, having watched the movies so much, those took a lot of images in my head as I was reading. Now, things are different here, but still it was helpful to imagine the movies as I was reading. BUT, the BOOKS ARE BETTER! This was really amazing. I can't stop thinking about these characters. </p>
                
            <p>They are deep and are important to the story, I am impressed. The world of Middle-Earth is very well defined and has some incredible history. I look forward to reading the Appendixes, and then reading The Silmarillion. I am excited to learn more about the history of Middle-Earth.</p>
                
            <p>I truly appreciate J.R.R. Tolkien, this story was from the 1950s, that is incredible! The stories I read today had this story to help the writers of my time, and it shows. </p>
                
            <p>The Return of the King is a book built on some deeeeep lore, and great character development, and plot development. I am IMPRESSED.</p>

            <h2>Memorable Quotes</h2>
            <p>This might be quite a long section for this review. </p>

            <p><em>And I warn you that peril is now both before you and behind you, and upon either side. (p.83)</em></p>

            <p><em>You must now make haste, and neither stay nor turn back; for the Shire is no longer any protection to you. (p.83)</em></p>

            <p><em>You can trust us to stick to you through thick and thin - to the bitter end. And you can trust us to keep any secret of yours - closer than you keep it yourself. But you cannot trust us to let you face trouble alone, and go off without a word. We are your friends, Frodo.(p.105)</em></p>

            <p><em>I am Aragorn, son of Arathorn; and if by life or death I can save you, I will. (p.171)</em></p>

            <p><em>I am learning a lot about Sam Gamgee on this journey. First he was a conspirator, now he's a jester. He'll end up by becoming a wizard - or a warrior! (p.208)</em></p>

            <p><em>Balin son of Fundin, Lord of Moria. (p.320)</em></p>

            <p><em>At that moment Gandalf lifted his staff, and crying aloud he smote the bridge before him. The staff broke asunder and fell from his hand. A blinding sheet of white flame sprang up. The bridge cracked. Right at the Balrog's feet it broke, and the stone upon which it stood crashed in to the gulf, while the rest remained, posed, quivering like a tongue of rock thrust out into emptiness. (p.331)</em></p>
