<h2 id="written">Written Review</h2>
<p>My first DNF… Did not finish.</p>

<p>Y’know, hmm. I can see exactly what this book was doing and it was very fine. Not my favorite style, at least right now. I may revisit this when I have some break between books, but no.</p>

<p>This could’ve been my fault, honest, I started on Book Three in this series (apparently) and well, I guess I don’t like this format of just solving small cases that get neatly wrapped up.</p>

<p>Each case was wrapped up within 20 or so pages and it was all very neat. Now, maybe as the book progressed it might change but, for the 100 pages I read everything was very neat and tidy, no loose ends.</p>

<h2>Notes as I read</h2>
<p>And you can see here, I was enjoying my time. But still, I have stopped enjoying myself.</p>

<h2>Written Review</h2>
<p>Well, I'll have to say I am pleasantly surprised by this book!</p>

<details id="spoilers">
    <summary>Spoilers</summary>
    <p>Different Scandals to solve..</p>

    <h2>A Scandal in Bohemia</h2>
    <p>Ahhh! A resolute ending for this particular mystery. I thought this was a great story to start this particular edition. I enjoyed this, and I appreciated the aspects of both Holmes and Watson. Great!</p>

    <h2>The Red-Headed League</h2>
    <p>Aha, another nice clean mystery solved! This was a nice concise story - I liked it.</p>

    <h2>The Case of Identity</h2>
    <p>A good case indeed. I like these bite-sized stories, they're quick and easy to understand. I'm not completely engaged with these stories because they're so bite-sized, but it's nice.</p>

    <h2>I Started With Book Three</h2>
    <p>I'm not sure about much of the backstory oh who Holmes and Watson are because I haven't read (apparently) the first 2 books! I apparently grabbed Book 3! OH NO! I do have some knowledge of Sherlock Holmes, I watched the show that was originally on Netflix titled, "Sherlock". I loved it! This book is collection of famous cases by the pair, Holmes and Watson! So, obviously I missed the backstory of Books 1 and 2.. whoops.</p>
