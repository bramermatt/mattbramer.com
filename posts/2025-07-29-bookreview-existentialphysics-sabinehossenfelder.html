                <p>When I picked up Existential Physics, I expected something closer to an introduction to physics—perhaps a beginner’s tour through particles, forces, and the nature of the universe. What I found instead was a dense and often provocative journey into the philosophical edges of science, where data meets speculation and certainty gives way to ambiguity. Sabine Hossenfelder doesn’t shy away from the big questions—free will, consciousness, the multiverse, the origin of the universe, and what might lie beyond it. But her tone is strikingly blunt: “we don’t really know,” or “this may change in a few decades.”</p>

<p>I don’t think I totally appreciate this book—for what it is, or maybe for who it’s written for. The bar of knowledge is high—unapologetically so—and while I could follow along most of the way, it took some effort. Hossenfelder writes like someone who eats quantum field theory for breakfast, and she doesn’t slow down to make sure you packed a snack. There are pages that feel like you’re being casually handed a graduate-level lecture while you’re still lacing up your shoes. If you’re not a desperate physics enthusiast—or someone who enjoys being humbled by concepts that bend time and logic—you may find yourself blinking at the page, wondering what just happened.</p>

<p>And when I say dense, I do mean dense. This isn’t “Physics for Poets.” This is “Physics for People Who Might Secretly Be Part of the CERN Staff.” And if you don’t get that joke, read this: <a href="https://home.cern/science/accelerators/large-hadron-collider" target="_blank">CERN Super Collider</a>. There’s beauty in that, no doubt—but also a lot of math-fog, and moments where the philosophical detours feel less like mile markers and more like sudden cliffs. It’s not that the book is inaccessible; it’s just that it doesn’t invite you in.</p>

<p>Still—I made it. Mostly. And I’m glad I did. But would I recommend this to the curious casual reader? Probably not. Unless that reader likes being repeatedly told “we don’t know” in increasingly complex ways.</p>

<p>As a Christian, I found myself regularly clashing with the worldview presented here. Hossenfelder is openly agnostic and often dismissive of religious or metaphysical explanations. She argues that physics must remain confined to what is observable and measurable, which naturally excludes questions of God, morality, and ultimate purpose. At times, her insistence on this boundary makes the book feel intellectually narrow, even while exploring some of the broadest questions imaginable. The level of scientific abstraction also occasionally creates a barrier—more philosophical than practical, and more speculative than certain.</p>

<p>And yet—this book did something deeply valuable for me. It made the limits of science unmistakably clear. For all its brilliance, science cannot tell us why the universe exists, only how it behaves. It cannot explain where meaning comes from, or why we hunger for beauty, purpose, and justice. The further I read, the more often I encountered answers wrapped in uncertainty: not just “we don’t know,” but “we may never know.” And even when science speaks with confidence, that confidence is almost always provisional—subject to revision by the next discovery.</p>

<p>That contrast brought my faith into sharper relief. Scientific theories may evolve or unravel, but the Word of God does not change. Scripture offers something science cannot: a consistent, trustworthy explanation of who we are, why we’re here, what’s gone wrong with the world, and how redemption is possible. It speaks with clarity where physics falters. It reveals a Designer, not just design; a purpose, not just pattern.</p>

<p><em>“Forever, O Lord, your word is firmly fixed in the heavens.” – Psalm 119:89</em></p>

<p><em>“Jesus Christ is the same yesterday and today and forever.” – Hebrews 13:8</em></p>

<p>So while I didn’t fully “appreciate” this book in the way it may have been intended, I do appreciate what it revealed. It uncovered a profound hunger—one that physics cannot satisfy. That hunger, I believe, points us not to deeper math or more data, but to the One who made it all.</p>
