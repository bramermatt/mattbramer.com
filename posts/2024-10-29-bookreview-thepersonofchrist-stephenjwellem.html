                <h2>Review</h2>
                <p>The Person of Christ: An Introduction by Stephen J. Wellum is an insightful entry in the Short Studies in Systematic Theology series, diving deeply into the identity of Christ as the Incarnate Son of God. Wellum explores the historical and theological foundations that have defined Christian understanding of Christ’s nature and person, revisiting early church councils that established these concepts. For those acquainted with systematic theology, Wellum’s handling of terms like "nature" and "person" offers an enriching understanding of how the church came to recognize Jesus as both fully God and fully human, a cornerstone of Christian faith.</p>
                    
                <p>The book goes beyond a surface-level study of Jesus by detailing how terms solidified through councils and debates over heresies, giving readers a glimpse into the precision necessary in articulating Christ's identity. This theological depth makes The Person of Christ a bit challenging for beginners, as some understanding of theological language is helpful. However, for readers ready to engage with these doctrinal details, Wellum offers a compelling, historically rooted perspective that emphasizes why clarity on these terms remains essential for understanding Christ's work and identity.</p>
                    
                <p>While The Person of Christ offers rich insights, it may not be required reading for someone simply wanting to know about Jesus on a personal or devotional level. The Scriptures themselves remain the best resource for this. But for those interested in systematic theology, Wellum’s book makes complex ideas accessible, even in a short format. It’s a rewarding read that underscores the importance of theological precision in understanding Christ as the Incarnate Son of God.</p>
