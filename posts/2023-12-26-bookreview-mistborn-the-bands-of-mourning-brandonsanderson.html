    <h2>Written Review</h2>
    <p>Mistborn Era Two.. I want to love you so much. I am such a huge fan of Brandon Sanderson's cosmere and specifically the Stormlight Archive. I love Wax and Wayne, I just think at this point, three books in, we've seen it all? I think I just want more out of this story. </p>
    
    <p>The coattails.. or mistcloattails are held on strong to the first era of Mistborn here. Ah, I do just want to love Mistborn but I just feel the story is just small and I feel we've done all that is possible in the magic system to this point - and what more could we do?</p>
    
    <p>The Set, Mister Suit, Telsin, Lessie.. all still here. And the Bands of Mourning, that's what you get, sort of. The Sanderlanch in this book is what brings the book up in my enjoyment. I wanted more from this book as I've said, and I can't shake that thought as I've read this second era. </p>
    
    <p>I thoroughly enjoy the Terris sections of the story is amazing, I love that part of the world and the Village and how Terris - and well really all of Era One - intereact with the world now. That is what I absolutely love reading. </p>
    
    <p>STERIS! Oh wow, she is so much more here. She gets a lot of page-time and it is just so amazing. I still enjoy Marasi, but Steris is great! </p>

    <h2>Notes from My Reading..</h2>
    <blockquote>Ah man, we're doing another fight with Allomancers on a train.. a little disappointing. I wonder if there is more to do with this magic system. I feel like we've seen it all up to this point. I love the Stormlight Archive because of it's HUGE magic system and mystery behind the magic system. This, I feel we know just about everything that's possible, because we've seen everything that is possible. We don't even have duralumin to increase the capacity of a Steelpush. Or even Mistborns anymore. Why aren't there Mistborns in Mistborn anymore??</blockquote>
    

    
    <h2>Spoilers</h2>
    <p>Be warned...</p>

    <details>
        <summary>Spoiler Story Breakdown</summary>
        <p>Telsin is still alive, and is known as Sequence - higher rank in the Set than Edwarn / Suit! Wow, I definitely thought Wax was going to die.. Harmony/Sazed can just bring people back to life now? Edwarn is finally dead, there are red-eyed kandra? I want more Mistborns, where are they all? Southern Scadrians? Wax and Steris also finally get married. </p>
    
        <p>Holy cow, we get a FLYING SHIP?! I'm really excited about that.</p>
        
        <p>The Bands of Mourning are such a small part of the whole story it felt like just a touchstone to Era Two. This only showed up and became important towards the last 100 or so pages, if that.</p>
        
        <p>Shadows of Self and the Bands of Mourning have been books where I am begging to get to the Sanderlanch to save the books. I'm hopeful for something better going into Mistborn: Secret History and The Lost Metal - I wonder how atium has to do with this series or will it be another macguffin like the Bands of Mourning.</p>
