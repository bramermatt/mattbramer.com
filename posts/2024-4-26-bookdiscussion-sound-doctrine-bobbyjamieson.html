                <h1>Sound Doctrine: How a Church Grows In the Love and Holiness of God by Bobby Jamieson Book Review</h1>
                
                
                    <h2>Started Reading</h2>
                    <p>Started reading April 25, 2024. Finished reading April 26, 2024.</p>
    
                    <h2>Written Review</h2>
                    <p>Ah, this will be a very different "review". This will be more of a book discussion regarding some highlights of this incredibly understandable biblically theological book on Sound Doctrine in the Church. Wow, I am blown away! This is really an awesome and succinct book with astounding teaching and learnings to be gleaned... I am blown away. I am currently preparing a sermon on John 19:28-42 and this was vastly helpful as I prepare my teaching. </p>
    
                    <p>In my reading of this work, I nearly ran out of ink in my highlighter. There were 108 pages in this work and I have a highlight on nearly every page. I highlighted based on something I wanted to read again, or share with my wife and children, or with my church. I learned so much while reading this book. I am going to try to articulate my own thoughts with my highlights. </p>
    
                    <p>With so many, I don't want to basically write the words in this book as my discussion, however I certainly think this is important for reading as a Christian. This is a great work that enlightens the reader with understandable teachings to anyone in the church from the nursery to the pulpit. Let's do it! </p>
    
    <h2>Back Cover</h2>
    <p><strong>How do you feel about Doctrine?</strong> <em>Whatever answer comes to mind, this book will not only convince you that sound doctrine is vital for living a godly life, it will also explain the essential role of theology in the life of a healthy church. After all, thinking rightly about God affects everything, from guiding us in practical issues to growing a church's unity and witness. This short, readable book shows how good theology leads to transformation, life, and joy.</em></p>

    <h2>A Couple Quotes</h2>
    <p>In an effort to not quote too much, here are six quotes..</p>
    
    <p><strong>Page 20</strong> <em>Sound doctrine leads to sound faith, sound hearts, and sound consciences. And these become the fountain from which flows an entire life that is pleasing to God.</em></p>
    
    <p><strong>Page 22</strong> 
        <em>However, unlike surfing, the very nature of the Christian life is corporate.</em></p>
            <p>
        <em>
        <ul>
            <li>To become a Christian is to be added to the church (Acts 2:31).</li>
            <li>To get baptized is to be baptized into the body of Christ (1 Cor. 12:13).</li>
            <li>To come to faith in Christ is to be brought near, nor just to God, but to God's people ( Eph. 2:17-22).</li>
            <li>To call on and obey God as Father is to have Christians for your brothers and sisters (Matt. 12:46-50).</li>
        </ul>
        </em>
            </p>
    
        <p><em>And growth as a Christian is consistently defined in corporate terms. How many fruits of the Spirit (Gal. 5:22-23) can you practice alone on a desert island?</em></p>
    
    <p><strong>Page 26</strong> <em>And a church's way of teaching and worshiping and praying and so on deeply impacts every member of the church - just like the culture of a family indelibly stamps every member of the family.</em></p>
    
    <p><strong>Page 30</strong> <em>Ultimately, the goal of reading and teaching Scripture is to love God and our neighbor better. And the way to love God more is to know God more.</em></p>
    
    <p><strong>Page 32</strong> <em>The Bible is a story that preaches a message. From beginning to end, the Bible tells a single story of salvation. From creation, through our fall into sin, to Jesus' saving work on the cross and the eventual restoration of God's rule over all creation, the Bible tells a single epic narrative that spans Genesis to Revelation. It tells the story of how God is working out salvation for his people through his Son Jesus. Yet this isn't just a story - it's a story that really happened. </em></p>
    
    <p>(this is something I love to read - someone's explanation of the way to salvation or the whole biblical message)</p>
    
    <p><strong>Page 97</strong> <em>Think about the importance of understanding the whole biblical story that the gospel completes - the narrative of creation and the fall, the exodus, Israel's conquest of the land, the judges and kings, and Israel's exile from their land and promised restoration. The better we know this story, the better we will understand the gospel, which is the fulfillment of this story. This is especially important for evangelizing people who have some knowledge of Scripture, such as those who have a Christian background, but have not repented of sin and trusted in Christ. When someone has a basic understanding of the Bible's storyline, we can build on that understanding and demonstrate how all the stories of Scripture find their ultimate meaning in the gospel.</em></p>
