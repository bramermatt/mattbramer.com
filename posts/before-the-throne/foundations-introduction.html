        <h2><strong>Introduction</strong></h2>
        <p>Hello, and thank you for taking the time to read my newest series - “<strong>Before the Throne</strong>”! I’m thrilled to finally begin a project I’ve been prayerfully considering for a while now: teaching and writing about what I believe as a follower of <strong>Jesus Christ</strong>. My faith is something I hold dear, and I look forward to sharing it with you—through the <strong>Bible</strong>, through <strong>doctrine</strong>, and through honest reflections along the way.</p>

        <h2><strong>Bio</strong></h2>
        <p>For those of you that don’t know, my name is <strong>Matthew Bramer</strong>. I was born in <strong>Clarksville</strong>, <strong>Indiana</strong>, in 1996. I’m a husband to my amazing wife <strong>Sandy</strong>—2025 marks our seventh wedding anniversary!—and a father to two wonderful children: <strong>Everett</strong> (5) and <strong>Hazel</strong> (1). I am a son to <strong>Andy</strong> and <strong>Ann Bramer</strong>. And, I am a brother to <strong>Jon Bramer</strong>. </p>
            
        <p>I serve as a pastor and worship leader at <a href="https://www.onecommunity.church" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>One Community Church</strong></a> in <strong>Clarksville</strong>, <strong>Indiana</strong>, where I’ve been pastoring since <strong>November 2024</strong>. Our congregation ranges from toddlers to 90-year-olds, and I have the privilege of teaching our adult classes on <strong>Sundays</strong> and <strong>Wednesdays</strong>. I also share the pulpit with two faithful brothers in <strong>Christ</strong>: my father and fellow pastor, <strong>Andy Bramer</strong>, and our fellow pastor, <strong>Daniel Tatum</strong>. We rotate weekly to preach and teach the <strong>Word of God</strong>—a joy and a high calling I don’t take lightly.</p>

        <h2><strong>Before the Throne</strong></h2>
        <p>This series is aimed at anyone who wants to understand the <strong>Christian faith</strong> more deeply. Whether you’re a brand-new believer, a seasoned saint, or simply curious about what the <strong>Bible</strong> teaches—welcome. We’ll explore both <a href="#term-bible"><strong>the Bible</strong></a> and <a href="#term-christian-doctrine"><strong>Christian doctrine</strong></a> in a way that is accessible, thoughtful, and rooted in <strong>Scripture</strong>.</p>

        <p>And just so I’m clear—I don’t consider myself the most knowledgeable person in the room. I’m learning, growing, and walking with <strong>Jesus</strong> right alongside you. This will be for new believers to the faith, seasoned saints, or those who are interested in learning more about what the <strong>Bible</strong> teaches and who the <strong>Savior of the World</strong> is, that’s <strong>Jesus of Nazareth</strong> by the way. </p>

        <p>I’m practically chomping at the bit to start writing—but before we dive in, it’s worth laying a few definitions down. With each article in this series, you’ll find a short glossary to help clarify key words and ideas as we go. Those definitions will be inside the article and at the end of the article. </p>

        <h2><strong>Closing</strong></h2>
        <p>As we begin, I’d like to offer you the most important truth of all: the <strong>gospel</strong>. The <strong>gospel</strong> is the good news that through the life, death, and resurrection of <strong>Jesus Christ</strong>, <strong>God</strong> has made a way to rescue sinners, reconcile us to Himself, and give us eternal life by grace through faith. This is the most precious gift the <strong>Creator of the universe</strong> could offer us. It is totally undeserved, and yet freely given to all who believe. </p>

        <p>We are all in desperate need of saving—and <strong>Jesus</strong> is the <strong>Savior</strong>.</p>
        <p><a href="#script-acts1631"><em>“Believe in the <strong>Lord Jesus</strong>, and you will be saved.”</em> <strong>Acts 16:31</strong></a></p> 
        
        <p>I will be including <strong>Scripture</strong> references throughout this series, because my authority is the <strong>Bible</strong>. I trust it. I live by it. And I encourage you to do the same. Thank you for joining me on this journey. I’m excited to see where <strong>God</strong> leads us as we explore His <strong>Word</strong> together. May He bless our time and draw us closer to Himself.</p>

        <h2><strong>Glossary</strong></h2>
        <p id="term-bible"><strong>The Bible</strong> – The <strong>Bible</strong> is the inspired, authoritative <strong>Word of God</strong>—66 books written by human authors under divine guidance—revealing <strong>God’s</strong> character, His redemptive plan through <strong>Jesus Christ</strong>, and how we are to live in response. </p>

        <p id="term-christian-doctrine"><strong>Christian Doctrine</strong> – <strong>Christian doctrine</strong> is the body of essential truths taught in <strong>Scripture</strong> that form the foundation of what <strong>Christians</strong> believe about <strong>God</strong>, salvation, humanity, and the world.</p>

        <h2><strong>Scripture References</strong></h2>
            <blockquote lang="en" id="script-acts1631">
            ‘They said, “Believe in the <strong>Lord Jesus</strong>, and you will be saved, you and your household.”’
