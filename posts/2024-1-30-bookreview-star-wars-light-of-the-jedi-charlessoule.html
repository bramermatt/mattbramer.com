<h2>Written Review</h2>
<p>So far, I'm hoping for more from my reading of Star Wars: The High Republic. This is the first book in Phase One of the High Republic and I'm left wanting more. There are hints at what I've been itching for in reading more Star Wars books - the Force and learning the history of the Star Wars universe, but maybe my expectations are just too high. Maybe I've just read such good fantasy prior to reading this, but this isn't the best thing I've read. That is not to say this was not a great Star Wars book, it was! It was! </p>

<p>A very good book, I say! We are the Republic! </p>

<p>The plot was intriguing, but certain beats held on a bit too long. I'm happy to be in the Star Wars universe again, but I'm just wanting more. I'm actually really looking forward to learning more about the Whills and the entire universe as a whole. I am looking for the big over-arching fantasy story, and I'm not getting that here. But that's just because this is a book one, not everything is going to be solved right off the bat. Oh, this is good!  </p>

<p>I will say, I did just finish Gardens of the Moon by Steven Erikson, book one in the Malazan Book of the Fallen series. An absolutely exceptional fantasy story with multiple races and deep character work, and an intriguing story. That could be why I'm struggling with this. Don't get me wrong, this is not a bad book or story! I've just read some absolutely incredible stories just before reading this. </p>

<p>Things have turned around... it's a new day of reading and WHOA has this story kicked off! </p>

<p>Yes, yes, this is a good book. A fun time, a great story. Jedi being Jedi. A lot of space flight and ship names, a lot of races in the Star Wars Universe. Just great stuff here! A little hints at histories prior to the story - which I love to read.</p>

<p>OH AND WITH THE GOOSEBUMPS TO END THIS BOOK. Nice job. This was such good Star Wars! Ah, I'm happy. The Light of the Jedi. </p>
